Days are filled with fireside discussions, wildlife watching and stunningly beautiful walks. With the nearest mobile signal a ten minute walk away, it‚Äôs a great place to ditch the digital and truly escape. Head over the bridge to your own private deck that happily houses a clever outdoor-kitchen and shower (complete with hot water). It‚Äôs the perfect spot to fry up breakfast whilst basking in peace and tranquility. There is also a flushing toilet situated just up the hill.And don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre not totally left to your own devices, on arrival you can expect bed linen, towels and a load of dry wood and kindling. If you feel the need to leave your new found homestead in the trees then the local area has lots of suitably chilled things to do. Head out on a moorland walk to take in some magical views - and perhaps even grab a pint at the local pub en route. Further afield, the stunning Elan Valley, a landscape bursting with impressive dams and reservoirs, is well worthy of an explore.

However, I am vaccinated and wear a mask in public indoor space.\n\nLet‚Äôs all be respectful and kind!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter your day of hiking, skiing, or touring local breweries and distilleries, come home to this beautiful, private tiny house in the trees! Or, just spend the day lazily relaxing by the fire and reading, while the sound of the stream soothes you.\n\nWalk through the woods, up the stairs, and enter into another dimension - one that you won\'t want to leave! Much thought was put into the design and local, natural, and recycled materials were a priority in its construction.\n\nSoak in the curated interior design while you relax in the living room space and gaze out the large, recycled windows (from an old, local schoolhouse).\n\nEnjoy the deck that overlooks the year-round stream (that may be frozen over in the winter) and let the sound of the water wash through you. You may even see some critters if you\'re still enough!\n\nThere is a sweet sitting area, hammock, and campfire space just below the treehouse right on the stream, with a dramatic view of the treehouse. And a hanging bed underneath!\n\nYou can cook simple meals on the propane campstove (with a griddle option) or use the small charcoal grill in the space under the treehouse. There is a mini-fridge with a separate freezer to keep your fresh produce from the farmers\' market and your yummy local beer nice and cool.

Open up the windows to hear the nighttime sounds of the forest!\n\nWe prioritize our earth and take environmental considerations into every decision: we generate solar electricity; we compost and recycle; we use environmentally friendly cleaning products; we avoid disposable items as much as possible; and we used many local and recycled materials in the construction of the treehouse.\n\nThe interior structure is 10\'x16\' with a loft and the deck is 4\'x16\'.', 'Guest access', ""Guest access\nAlthough official check-in is at 5pm, if you'd like to check in before this time, please inquire and we may be able to accommodate.\n\nYou have exclusive access to the entire treehouse.\n\nThe treehouse is about 200 feet from the driveway and house, yet it's very private in the woods.\n\nI have a garden cart you can use to transport your belongings to the treehouse.\n\nIf you arrive early and the treehouse is not ready yet, you are welcome to leave your things on the porch at the house."", 'Other things to note', ""Other things to note\nYou must be physically able to climb stairs and ladders to stay here.

We do not allow dogs (or any other pets) in the sleeping loft.\n\nThis area of Vermont (the Northeast Kingdom) has snow all winter, and sometimes mud, especially in the spring. The treehouse is located on a dirt/gravel road that can sometimes be challenging if it's muddy or even snowy or icy. We can get a lot of snow sometimes and you could possibly get stuck on your way here or in the driveway. I do my best to keep the driveway clean and sanded, but it's not always possible all of the time. We live in a rural area and services are not always immediately available.\n\nAll of that being said, most of the time there are no issues but if you have access to a 4WD vehicle, ideally with higher clearance and snow tires, that is the best case scenario. Keep an eye on the weather and plan ahead: the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont is probably not like where you're from and being prepared for weather and challenging driving conditions is absolutely the best policy.\n\nThere is a primitive composting toilet in the treehouse, with regular bathroom access (toilet, sink, washer, dryer, shower) in the main house, which is about 200 feet away.\n\nWifi is not (barely?) available at the treehouse, but it is at the house. There is a phone (landline) at the treehouse and minimal/intermittent cell reception.\n\nI provide at least two gallons of water that can be used for either drinking and/or washing. I encourage you to fill the water up at the house if you need more than this (there is a faucet option in the shower) rather than bringing in bottles. Our water is great!\n\nThere is a camping cookstove available (with a griddle), a charcoal grill, toaster oven and a mini-fridge. You should be able to find all you need for basic cooking there.\n\nPlease understand that you are likely to come across various critters - anything from fairly large spiders (most likely - they love the water) to bears and moose (less likely). Walking down to the treehouse you may come across our resident chipmunk, and will often hear owls and loons at night. So, if you want to stay here you must be comfortable with insects and wildlife!

Then, relax on the deck and enjoy the magic of the trees.\n\n‚Ä¢Airbnb ‚ÄúTop 20 Places to Stay in VA‚Äù\n‚Ä¢""Best of Richmond"" by Style Magazine\n‚Ä¢Featured in Airbnb article on hospitality\n‚Ä¢One of ""8 Great Airbnbs"" in the U.S. by Inside Hook\n\n‚Ä¢Complementary bikes\n‚Ä¢Comes with bathroom, kitchenette & lounge apartment in host house\n‚Ä¢Dog-friendly\n\nSocial media: @trailside_treehouse', 'The space', ""The space\nWhen you stay in the treehouse, you‚Äôre not just embarking on an incredible adventure for your family‚Äîyou‚Äôre also helping the Richmond-area community by supporting non-profits that are aligned with our mission of supporting children and the outdoors. We donate a large portion of your payment to local non-profits and thank you for being a positive part of our community.\n\n~~\n\nHere's your chance to fulfill that childhood dream of running away and camping out in a treehouse. This is not a tiny house wrapped around a tree or a glamorous treehouse complete with running water and a kitchen. Instead, this is an authentic treehouse that we built for our nephew in 2014, complete with reclaimed redwood walls and windows from our old house. It's an authentic kid-like treehouse experience; a space devoted to the stuff of childhood dreams.\n\nLOCATION: The Trailside Treehouse is centrally located in Richmond, Virginia, just minutes from I-95 and I-64. It is directly across the river from one of Richmond's popular parks called Maymont. The James River Park System and Buttermilk Trail also come through the property, thanks to an easement we have given the city. The treehouse property itself includes five wooded acres with nationally-celebrated single-track trail and is adjacent to the river--just hike down the trail and cross a single train track and you'll find some of Richmond's best fishing and swimming!\n\nTHE SPACE: As we designed the treehouse space, we asked ourselves one question: what would we have wanted in a treehouse as kids? The Trailside Treehouse is our answer to that question--it's a magnum opus to childhood.\n\nPlease note: There is a zipline on the property. Per our insurance company, guests are not allowed to use it. Please prepare your children ahead of time so they're not bummed when they arrive!\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT: The treehouse isn‚Äôt an inexpensive place to stay. It‚Äôs not simply a comfortable room to call home as you pass through town, as are many Airbnb‚Äôs. Instead, it‚Äôs an unparalleled experience that we hope transforms our guests by bringing them back to their childlike centers. It‚Äôs a place to practice juggling or learn new yo-yo tricks. It‚Äôs a place to flip through a book about bowling rules and get curious about things you haven‚Äôt wondered about since you were a kid. There are notes to discover in the nooks and crannies. There are games you may not have played with since you were a child. There's a bin of junk food and a fridge with sodas. We've stocked the treehouse with activities that we hope reminds you of the curiosity you had as a child. We want you to feel that your time here is invaluable‚Äîthat it is a priceless trip that sets you up for a transformative week or month or year. Reinvigorates. Rejuvenates. Renews your very sense of self.\n\nVALUABLE MEMORIES TO LAST A LIFETIME\nWe know the treehouse experience is an investment that many families save for. Our goal is to provide you with value beyond your expectations so that you truly feel that your time exploring here with your friends and family was worth every cent. Our guests who get the most value from the experience are those guests who are willing to leave their phones in their bags and truly live in the simplicity and wonder of the moment. We want you to imagine that you are your 10-year old self and have packed a backpack with all of your favorite things and run away to your neighbor's treehouse in the woods. Even those guests bringing kids should feel ready to loosen the reigns of responsibility for awhile to just enjoy the space and get optimum value from their time here.\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nDESIGN AND TOUR HISTORY\nThis two-story treehouse was designed by renowned Richmond architect, Henry Tenser, and modeled after a western firetower. It was featured (alongside the modern home where the hosts live) on the 2017 Virginia Home and Garden Tour as well as three Westover Hills Neighborhood Association tours and the Modern Richmond Tour.\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nTRAILSIDE LOCATION IN THE CITY\nThe treehouse sits in our back yard at the top of a wooded gully that leads to the James River Park System and is mere yards from the popular Buttermilk Trail--one of the most celebrated urban single-track trail systems in the entire country. For trail-lovers and adventure-lovers, you simply can't find a better spot to stay the night in Richmond, Virginia.\n\n**please note that we are located within the city, so you can expect to hear city sounds, which may include trains, sirens, traffic and other things.\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nBRIDGE TO CHILDHOOD\nTo access the treehouse, you'll cross a wooden bridge and enter onto the main deck. If you're ready to play, jump into the twisty tube slide and play on the playground equipment beneath the main floor. If you're ready to relax, take a seat on the deck and enjoy your wooded surroundings.\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nPORCH LEVEL\nEnter the main floor screened porch through the screened doors. The main floor is screened in on all four sides and features two hammock swings--the perfect place to read a book or recount your day on the trail as you rock amongst the trees--mosquito-free (a rare summer treat for Richmond).\n\nWhen more than 4 people wish to stay in the treehouse, this first floor can be transformed into an additional sleeping area with a fold-up memory foam mattress or single cots. Just let us know if you need those!\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nSLEEPING LEVEL\nThe sleeping area on the second story is located up a knee-hole ladder and through a trap door. The second story is surrounded by windows on all four sides, including two fish-eye windows so you can poke your head into the concave plexiglass and get a look at the ground three stories below. The second story also features a balcony, which is accessible through a screen door. You'll sleep soundly under the corrugated corten steel roof. The sleeping quarters features a queen bed with a memory foam mattress and a bunkbed cot.\n\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\nLOUNGE, BATHROOM AND KITCHENETTE\nInside the host house, you'll have full, private use of our basement, which includes a temperature-controlled lounge area with a TV, sleeper sofa, bean bag chair, kitchenette with sink, microwave, and Keurig, and full bathroom. The entrance to the lower level is private and accessible from the exterior of the home.\n\nThe bike room is also in this basement space. You are welcome to take out a bike as long as you sign a waiver and wear a helmet! There are 4 bikes to use for free.\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nGUEST COUNT AND SLEEPING COMFORTABLY\nPlease let us know in advance how many guests are in your party so we can set up beds, set out the appropriate number of towels, pillows, blankets and make sure there are enough snacks and drinks.\n\nOur standard guest limit is 6. If you want to bring a larger party, we have some options. Let us know and we will help you figure out whether the options suit your travel style, including the sleeper sofa inside and putting two children per level of the cot, and sleeping in any of the hammocks. ~\n\nStandard sleeping arrangements are as follows (let us know if you'd like something different):\n-1-2 guests: queen bed on 2nd floor\n-3-4 guests: queen bed + bunkbed cot on 2nd floor\n-5-6 guests: queen bed + bunkbed cot on 2nd floor + fold-up memory foam mattress on 1st floor NOTE: when there are families with more than two kids, we recommend fitting two kids per level of the bunkbed cot so everyone can sleep on the same level\n~~\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nDOGS ARE WELCOME!\nIf you‚Äôre bringing your dog(s), please let us know. Our dog is very friendly.\n\nSingle night options are available upon request and availability.

Garden spigot water comes from rainwater collected from the roof."", 'Other things to note', 'Other things to note\nsummer guests‚Äî yes, it can be hot. Again, think of the treehouse of your childhood dreams. It doesn‚Äôt have ac! Overnight temps are typically in the 70s and we have fans. If you need temperature controlled environments, plan to spend time and sleep in the basement lounge of the host house. If summer glamping isn‚Äôt appealing, book your stay in the spring or fall when temps are milder. :)\n\nWinter guests: see above only opposite.\n\nSingle night options are sometimes available. Contact us if you\'d like to book just one night.\n\nPlease‚Äîno candles or open flames in the treehouse, including grills or propane cooktops.\n\nRIVER ACCESS‚ÄîThe treehouse property includes five wooded acres with trails for you to explore. A train track borders our property to the north and just on the other side of the track is a popular river swimming and fishing spot. You can hike to the river easily and spend a day enjoying swimming, floating, fishing, water sports and exploring. Rock hopping is very popular in Richmond.\n\nFOOD ODORS‚ÄîPlease no fish or fragrant food/items in the treehouse or lounge. This includes cologne, perfume, fish, fish, incense, fish, and any other odors that may take a few days to air out, especially, but not limited to, fish.\n\nZIPLINE‚ÄîThere is a zipline on the property. Per our insurance company, guests are not allowed to use it. Please prepare your children ahead of time so they\'re not bummed when they arrive!\n\nTRAIL ACCESS‚ÄîThe trail off of the treehouse property is a single track trail that leads to 40 miles of a nationally recognized trail system. It‚Äôs very technical for riders and should only be attempted by advanced riders. It‚Äôs great for hikers and runners at all levels. If you are borrowing treehouse bikes and want to ride the trail, avoid the single track Buttermilk trail...you‚Äôll want to ride the bikes a mile downriver on the road to Reedy Creek to pick up the fire road, which is flat and awesome for riders at all levels. From the fire road, ride down river two miles to Belle Isle then circle the island or ride all over the city, including the canal walk and Capital Trail. Togwatee‚Äîfrom here you can go anywhere!!\n\nBONFIRE‚ÄîWe have firewood, lighters and fire starters. Plan to have a bonfire. You may want to bring your own starter log if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with starting a fire. The kind you‚Äôd use in a fireplace works!\n\nEGRESS AND LADDER‚ÄîThe sleeping quarters are up a ladder and through a 24""x24"" opening. Please be comfortable climbing the ladder and moving through the opening. If you\'re pregnant, you may want to measure your belly.\n\nWEATHER‚ÄîWe do not refund cancellations for weather reasons. Please be aware when booking that you could get inclement weather, including storms, snow, wind, etc. For that reason, you need to be comfortable assuming some weather-related risk before you book.\n\nRESCHEDULING‚ÄîWe do allow guests to reschedule in some cases as long as they request the rescheduling 10 days prior to the day of stay or more.\n\nURBAN NOISES‚ÄîThe treehouse is located on five wooded acres in the center of Richmond City. Our property is only one of about a dozen riverside properties in the entire city, so you will have easy access to the river while enjoying life in the trees. Along with lots of wildlife, you will hear city sounds, which we refer to in our family as ‚Äúurban waves‚Äù like the sounds of beach waves. These noises may include sirens, trains, and traffic, along with all the sounds of nature and your loved one‚Äôs laughter and cheer.\n\nHOST FAMILY INTERACTION AND SPACE USE‚ÄîOur family lives in the property and our home is very close to the treehouse. Our family plays in the front yard when guests are in residence and we leave the back yard for guests to enjoy on their own. Guests should be comfortable and open to seeing our kids in the driveway and front yard. :)\n\nELECTRICITY LIMITATIONS‚ÄîThe treehouse is on a 20 AMP power circuit. If too many devices are plugged in and running, the breaker may trip, causing power loss. Please let us know right away if you lose power.\n\nHEATERS‚ÄîWe provide heaters that are approved by our insurance company. Please do not bring your own.\n\nHOT PLATES‚ÄîDue to safety concerns, please do not use hot plates or other heating or cooking devices within the treehouse.\n\nGUEST COUNT‚ÄîPlease let us know in advance how many guests are in your party so we can set up the beds, set out the appropriate number of towels, and make sure there are enough snacks and drinks. We want everyone in your group to have an awesome experience. If we don‚Äôt know a guest is coming, we won‚Äôt have set up a comfortable space for him/her and he/she will not have towels, blankets, pillows, snacks, drinks, and all the fun stuff that makes glamping in the treehouse such a memorable experience. Thank you!\n\n\nWATER‚ÄîDrink water from the kitchen and sink faucets, but not the garden spigots.

The Tree House is hand-crafted, one of 3 casitas and 3 treehouses at the Bio Thermales natural resort organically integrated into our 35 acre rainforest. Guests enjoy free access, from 9 am to 10 pm to the 15 natural hot and cool springs pools of various temperatures and rainforest trails.', 'The space', 'The space\nPlease message us if we will be your first or last destination in Costa Rica. We highly recommend booking on weekdays for more privacy and tranquility, as we have more day visitors from 9 am to 6 pm to our hot springs on the weekends, especially Sundays. If your reservation includes a Sunday, we highly recommend planning a day outing to the many wonderful nearby activities.\n\nWe are three hours north of San Jose (airport), 45 minutes east of Fortuna and Volcano Arenal, and the many activities there and nearby.\n\nGuests enjoy 24/day access* to our hot springs and trails in our 35 acre rainforest at no extra charge. The pools are cleaned every morning starting at 6 am, but one hot spring will always be available. Many factors may dictate scheduling, including weather. We do not charge for children 17 and under -- but we will not accept reservations for the Tree House for families with children under 5 years old for whom a 20 foot fall from the balcony would be very serious.\n\nOur hot springs are ancient ‚Äúdeep Earth‚Äù sources that bubble up through the rainforest floor, laden with mineral-rich waters that have been in the Earth for at least 10,000 years. Our waters are rich in bicarbonates, calcium and magnesium, low in sulfur, and slightly acidic -- qualities shared by many of the world\'s best hot springs.\n\nFive of our 9 organic form hot springs pools are located in the rainforest, and 4 hot springs pools as well as a small and a large cool spring swimming pool are located in a meadow, surrounded by rainforest (see below for more information). The small and large cool springs pools both have water slides, and there is a small water slide in one of the shallow and moderate temperature pools for small children.\n\nThe Tree House is built to strict Costa Rican building codes, but as with all tree houses, there is some movement when the wind blows, and this could be uncomfortable for people very sensitive to motion sickness.\n\nYou may see our other listings on Airbnb at:\n\nTucano Casita (Toucan Casita) is listed as ""Rainforest Casita with Hot Springs"": airbnb.com/rooms/30358\n\nMariposa Casita (Butterfly Casita) is listed as ""Rainforest Casita2 with Hot Springs"" airbnb.com/rooms/51518\n\nColibri Casita (Hummingbird Casita) is listed as ""Rainforest Casita3 with Hot Springs""\nairbnb.com/rooms/1896911\n\nTree House: ""Rainforest Tree House with Hot Springs"" airbnb.com/rooms/50435\n\nYou can check availability of each accommodation by clicking on the ""Calendar"" tab above the main photo on each listing.\n\nTree House features: (see floor-plan for all details):\n‚Ä¢ Perched high among the rainforest trees, the Tree House has large screened areas for circulation of naturally cooler breezes.

Bio Thermales is generally not crowded, however, except on major holidays and Sundays.\n\nFood/Meals: The Tree House has a kitchen. There are many restaurants and a good supermarket within a 15 minute drive. Traditional Costa Rican meals can be delivered from a local caterer for very reasonable prices (Costa Rican food is tasty but not spicy). Otherwise, for those without cars, we can call a taxi or synchronize a food shopping trip when we go to town for errands.\n\nDriving from SJO airport: Please message us before booking if we are your first and/or last destination in Costa Rica.\n\nWe recommend at least a small 4 wheel drive car. The last 3 kilometers are country roads.\n\nThree hours of daylight are needed to safely drive here from the SJO airport before sunset at 5:30 pm. The drive through mountainous cloud forests is splendid in daylight, but prone to fog and rain, especially at night, creating hazardous visibility conditions after dark. Finding our countryside location will also be far easier if you arrive the first time before sunset. If your plane lands in the morning to noon, you can drive here directly from the airport. Otherwise, it is safer to book a room near the airport on your first night, or ask us to book a private driver ($145) and have a rental car delivered at no extra charge.\n\nLast night in Costa Rica:\nDriving directly to the SJO airport on the same day is possible if you book a flight in the afternoon. Please be aware that you must be at the airport 2.5 hours before departure. If you have an early morning departing flight it is basically necessary to stay near the airport on the night before.', 'Guest access', 'Guest access\nFive of our 9 organic form hot springs pools are located in the rainforest, and 4 hot springs pools as well as a small and a large cool spring swimming pool(with water slides) are located in a meadow, surrounded by rainforest and one cool fresh spring pool in the rainforest (see below for more information). Tree House guests can enjoy the hot springs pools from 9am to 10 pm, and 35 acres of rainforest access at no charge. The pools are cleaned daily from 6 am to 9 am but one pool is always available -- there are many factors involved, including weather, that may dictate when the pools are ready. We have a staff operated laundry facility and guests may give clothes for washing/drying/folding for $5/load.', 'Other things to note', 'Other things to note\nDay visitors and groups are permitted entrance to use the hot springs and cool springs pools from 9 am to 6 pm. There are usually more day visitors on weekends, especially Sundays, and we recommend booking week days for more tranquility and privacy. If guests book a longer reservation that includes a Sunday, we recommend planning a day tour in the many nearby activities on Sundays. Day visitors must leave by 6 pm, and only casita and Tree House guests may use the pools after 6 pm and enjoy unlimited access to the pools, with the exception of no nighttime use of the forest pools, and cleaning schedule as noted above.\n\nWe recommend either ordering a catered dinner in advance for your first evening and/or next morning breakfast, or buying and bringing groceries to cook because we are 4 km from the main paved road and driving after dark is highly discouraged until drivers have quite some experience on Costa Rican roads. Also, most guests prefer to settle in upon arrival and not to have to get back in the car and drive out to dinner. We provide a Catering Menu to each guest once reserved, but the caterer requires advance notice of selected meals and TIMES guests would like meals delivered. We do not have a liquor license and guests must bring their own beer/wine/rum etc. The tap water is safe to drink, and we sell soft drinks, fruit juices, and other non-alcohol beverages, snacks and ice cream.']","['What this place offers', 'Bathroom', 'Shampoo', 'Hot water', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Washing machine', 'Dryer', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Hangers', 'Bed linen', 'Family', 'Baby safety gates', 'Home safety', 'Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Dedicated workspace', 'A desk or table with a chair and space for a laptop.', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Refrigerator', 'Microwave', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Stove', 'Coffee maker', 'Location features', 'Private entrance', 'Separate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor', 'Private patio or balcony', 'Garden', 'An open space on the property usually covered in grass', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Free on-street parking', 'Pool', 'Services', 'Luggage drop-off allowed', ""For guests' convenience when they are arriving early or departing late"", 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Host greets you', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: TV\nTV', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Hair dryer\nHair dryer', 'Unavailable: Smoke alarm\nSmoke alarm', 'There is no smoke alarm on the property.', 'Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm', 'There is no carbon monoxide detector on the property.', 'Unavailable: Heating\nHeating']",San Carlos Alajuela Province Costa Rica,4,3,1,61,4.8,4.9,4.9,4.7,4.9,4.8,28,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/50435?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A8188&children=0&infants=0&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2022-05-13&check_out=2022-05-20&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=eebf9d56-f119-426a-b39b-9d89928069dc,2,

Enjoy seclusion and incredible views, hiking, and quietude. There is a spring-fed pond available for swimming nearer to the farmhouse and farm events and dinners can be arranged.\n\nThe indoor space:\nthe queen bed, fold-out sofa, kitchen, living, bathroom, and patio with hammock, are all part of the main floor. There are two (10ft) lofts above; one with a double bed and one with a twin. The ""bedrooms"" are not closed off from one-another - see photos. The house is built within the trees, which move and creak subtly if it is windy. The toilet is the best composting toilet available ‚Äî it looks like a regular toilet and the waste closes behind a door, but note that it does not have a water flush. The shower is a hot (outdoor) shower on the front porch, with a curtain.\n\n*Important Information Regarding The Treehouse at Bliss Ridge Farm*\nWe would like for you to understand a few important facts before you arrive...Being a tree house guest has its benefits and its limitations.\nBuilding and caring for a treehouse in nature was a labor of love and not an easy endeavor. We hope that you will appreciate how special it is, enjoy the majesty of mother nature and at the same time will understand its limitations and respect our operating instructions. There is an explicit information sheet when you get here but we want you to be prepared ahead of time.\nThere is no electricity and no plumbing. However, there is a solar panel to provide you with lights and cell phone charging. Please note that cell phone service is limited to texting and sometimes a phone call.\nThere is a composting toilet which is very modern and clean but you need to follow the directions that are clearly posted.\nThere is hot and cold water for a kitchen sink, and an outside shower.\nBecause the treehouse is in the woods, nature will take over when it can, i.e. mice may come in in the fall to try and nest in warm places in Vermont. We hope that you do not leave food around to entice them. We monitor mouse traps so you will not have to deal with that.\nSometimes some rainwater may come down the large inside tree if it is windy and raining hard. We provide towels to put on the floor around the tree if this happens. (It stays in a small area around the tree)\nIf you have small children, we trust that you will take responsibility for them. Please monitor them on the loft stairs, help them to use the toilet properly, and don‚Äôt let them take food away from the dining tables that are inside and on the deck.\nBeing mindful of being in nature will help prevent mice, ants, and bugs and it will help us to keep the treehouse clean and smelling fresh.\nWe have an organic farm and respect nature and do not want to be wasteful. We hope that you will divide your garbage into recycling, trash, and compost (receptacles are clearly marked on the bridge) and please do not bring plastic water bottles onto the property. We will provide you with two x 2 gallon containers of fresh spring water and refill whenever you would like.\nNo smoking in the treehouse or on the decks please.\nWe wish you a wonderful, adventurous experience.

Here you can hike, meditate, relax, read, write, mushroom hunt, fish, create art, music, photography, bird watch, cross country ski, snowshoe, and star gaze as there is little light pollution, along with many other activities in a private woodland setting.\n\nThe space, which is 168 ft.¬≤ or 15.6 m¬≤ has electricity, but not running water. Hand sanitizer is provided along with a wash basin or you can use the sink at the main house to wash your hands. Soap, wash cloths, and towels are stored in a container under the bed. On top of the cabinet there is complimentary hand made glycerin soap. Bottled water is provided or you can fill up a container at the shower as the well water is very good. The composting toilet is conveniently located in the tree house and is vented so there is no odor. Toilet paper is provided. There are directions on the bathroom wall on how to use it. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY so that it will function properly. NEVER urinate with the chute open.\n\nThe tree house has a locking door and six large windows with screens and shades for privacy. The key is located on top of the cabinet. There are two stained glass transoms above the front windows and two more in the apexes. The space has a queen size bed with a comfy hybrid coil memory foam mattress. There are 400 thread count sheets with plenty of pillows and quilts along with a faux fur throw. Two bed side tables with Tiffany style lamps complement each side along with two tall white birch logs decorated with branches, crystals and fairy lights.

There is also an electric fireplace for cold nights or you can just enjoy watching the flames without heat. On very cold nights we also supply a propane heater, though the electric fireplace is usually sufficient.\n\nAlthough there is no traditional kitchen, there is space inside on top of the cabinet, table and outdoor tables to prepare your meals. There is no fridge or microwave. We do have a large lobster pot and a tripod pizza grill available upon request.\n\nThere is a cabinet which stores some camping essentials such as a propane camp stove, dinnerware, cutlery, cutting board, sugar and sugar substitutes, spices, oil, tin foil, creamers, pots, pans, lighters, scissors, wine bottle and can opener, extra light bulbs, mugs, dish drying cloth, umbrellas, first aid kit, paper towels, Lysol cleaner, flashlights, propane, insect repellent and a battery powered lantern.

Maps are provided in the book binder and trail markers are posted along the way. There are many benches and chairs along the trail where you can sit, relax and enjoy the scenery. While hiking the trails walking poles or sticks are suggested as the terrain is hilly with some stone steps and steep areas. Two walking sticks hang on the wall in the tree house. Because of the terrain hiking boots are strongly recommended. Due to the nature of the trails no ATV, dirt or mountain biking is allowed. These are hiking trails only. We ask that you please respect the private sign as this trail leads to the Octagon where guests may be staying. There is a good distance between the buildings so you will not be able to see each other even in winter. We wanted to make each site secluded and private. While hiking, please stay on our side of the brook as the opposite side is owned by our neighbor.\n\nIt is a five minute walk to the spring fed pond which is part of Goldmine brook. The brook is rated class A and supports a myriad of wildlife including river otters, mink and great blue herons. If you like to fish bring your gear to try for pickerel, large and small mouth bass, white and yellow perch, shiners and native trout. Previous guests have had great luck fly fishing here.\n\nIf you are looking for a place to swim, canoe or kayak visit Gardner Lake state park in Salem which is only 15 minutes away. ( you will have to supply your own canoe or kayaks) Depending on water flow, you can also take a dip right here in the small pool below the Goldmine brook waterfall which is a 20-25 minute walk down the trail or you can go for a swim in gold mine brook pond which is only a five minute walk away.

If your device is supported by an Internet provider you will be able to get online.\n\n\nFor the nature enthusiast, take part in a guided nature walk where Nancy will discuss the history, plants, animals, geology and mushrooms found in the area. The walk costs 15 dollars per person and lasts about an hour and a half to two hours. We usually cover 2 miles and may go off trail. After the hike we will go to the house and sample some Autumn berry syrup, Shagbark hickory syrup, sassafras syrup, spice bush pepper and acorn or mushroom cookies when available. We also have shagbark hickory syrup for sale.

(I do apologize if this sounds over the top in anyway, a few bad apples are why we had to implement such things).\n\nPlease let us know your estimated time of arrival on arrival day so I know when to come down from the trees and keep an eye out. Showing up without giving me a heads up could cause up to an hour wait time until I can get you checked in since I could be in the middle of a project in the forest.\n\nWe try to be as accommodating as possible by having a 4 hour check in window, if you want to check in out side of that time frame we will do so to the best of our abilities at a charge of $30 per hour.\n\nThe bathroom consists of a composting toilet which is on the same treehouse platform. We have a seasonal heated outdoor shower which is operational in the warmer months. We will provide you with some drinking water in a bottle and hand sanitizer.\n\nThe treehouse is well insulated and has electric heaters that will keep you plenty warm on the coldest of Vermont nights.\n\nFor those that want to disconnect while still being able to connect we now have internet and a small smart tv in this treehouse!\n\nWe will help bring your belongings up to the treehouse upon your arrival but can not guarantee help bringing them back down as we both work in the mornings.\n\nWe want to make sure everyone who visits our treehouse knows what they are booking by reading the description and not just our glorious reviews because the experience at our treehouse is not for everyone.

There is NO PLUMBING, but we provide a jug of spring water and there's an outhouse at the base of the stairs. The farm also has a centrally located Community Kitchen and a Bath House which are shared with other guests on the farm. NO PETS - NO EXCEPTIONS. Please read ALL the house rules and full description. HomeGrown HideAways is also on FB and IG."", 'The space', ""The space\nHomeGrown HideAways is a hundred-acre farm, campground, and event facility with treehouses, yurts, cabins, camping, etc. The owners, Nathan & Jessa, live onsite with a parade of dogs, cats, chickens, and ducks. For the safety of our own animals (and yours), we cannot allow any additional animals onto the farm. Anyone arriving with an animal of any kind will not be allowed to stay and no refund will be given.\n\nINTERIOR: The interior of the Treetop Flyer is complete with 4 double beds, pillows, sheets, and light blankets (2 futons that fold open on the main floor and 2 mattresses in the loft), barnwood table with 2 benches for eating and playing games, and a jug of spring water. There is an electric fireplace for heat, but no indoor plumbing. You get the entire treehouse to yourself. A trash can is provided, but we do not have trash service on the farm so you need to take your trash to town with you upon departure. (NOTE: Please let us know if you plan to bring your own linens. We offer a linen discount of $3 per person if we don‚Äôt have to do extra laundry. Beds will still come with a fitted sheet and pillows with pillowcases, just no blankets or top sheet. You can request the discount as a refund or farm credit to use towards eggs, firewood, or other items).\n\nEXTERIOR: The treehouse features a covered, wrap-around porch above and massive deck below with swing, picnic table, propane grill, and firewood bundles (bring cash). The upstairs porch and lower deck have solar lights. Please note that the lights do not come on until dark and they will only stay on for as much time as the battery was able to re-charge during the day. A private outhouse is just a few steps away from the base of the stairs or you can use the shared-use bath house in the main camping field. There is also a nearby firepit that overlooks the gardens. Parking is available at the base of the treehouse is but very limited. If you are bringing a group, some will need to park in the parking area near the Community Kitchen.\n\nCHECK-IN/CHECK-OUT: Guests can check in any time after 4pm, but we do recommend arriving before dark. Depending on our cleaning schedule, we may be able to accommodate an earlier arrival time with advance notice. Rentals are unlocked so guests can just follow the instructions sent with the check-in email to find their location and let themselves in. Check-out is at 11am so that we have time to clean the rental before the next guest arrives. If something comes up and you need to leave before your scheduled check-out date, please do us the courtesy of sending a message once you have cell service so that we know not to expect you.\n\nUNPLUG AND RECONNECT: HomeGrown HideAways does not have cell service or wifi, but there is a landline in the Community Kitchen for guests to use. We hope that you will take the opportunity to re-connect with nature, yourself, your family, and other guests. In addition to the shared kitchen space, we also have a pavilion with cornhole set up for rainy days, and a massive bonfire area where we encourage guests to pitch in on firewood to share stories and s‚Äômores. Please note that quiet hours are from 10pm ‚Äì 7am and sound carries far in the holler.\n\nSHARED BATH HOUSE: In addition to year-round outhouses, there is a seasonal BATH HOUSE with 4 flush toilets and 2 solar-heated showers. The bath house is rustic with a concrete floor so we recommend shower shoes or flip flops. Towels and toiletries are not provided, but we do have extra for purchase if you forget yours. In the winter months, when the bath house is closed, we open the restrooms in the community building for showering (1 full bath and 1 half bath).\n\nCOMMUNITY KITCHEN: The farm has a brand new (2021), centrally-located, solar-powered, chef-inspired COMMUNITY KITCHEN with 4 ovens, 5-burner gas cooktop, microwave, refrigerator with farm-fresh eggs, coffee-maker, toaster, dishes, cutlery, baking sheets, basic cooking supplies (oil, salt, pepper, etc), plus HomeGrown farm goods, s‚Äômore kits, and other goodies. BRING CASH for the honor system. Please remember that this space is available for ALL visitors of the farm so guests are expected to clean up after themselves and not to loiter when others are waiting. To prevent over-crowding, we ask that a maximum of TWO people from your group occupy the space at a time and children MUST be accompanied by a guardian at all times. Meals may be eaten at the picnic tables on the porch, under the pavilion, or you can take food back to your site. FOOD SCRAPS MUST BE PUT INTO THE COMPOST BIN ‚Äì NOT IN THE TRASH. Please do not discard food on the ground as it can make our animals sick and attract unwanted wildlife.\n\nTHE FARM: We are a farm in the mountains so we have all the good (beautiful views, babbling brook, hiking trails) and the bad (insects, howling coyotes, poison ivy) that nature has to offer so come prepared. We recommend hiking boots, bug spray, and weather-appropriate clothing. Be prepared to encounter INSECTS (mosquitoes, ticks, chiggers), WILDLIFE (deer, turkey, snakes, toads, and dare we mention the bear track we spotted one spring?), WEATHER (hot, cold, rain, snow), TOXIC PLANTS (poison ivy, stinging nettle, wild mushrooms), just to name a few. There is a steep and rugged 1.5-mile hiking loop that takes most folks about an hour (if they can get past the first 10-minute uphill climb). We also have playground swings, disc golf, hula hoops, a croquet set, and a creek full of geodes to hunt.\n\nCAMPFIRES: Most sites have their own fire pit except for the primitive camping area. There is also a large communal fire pit near the Community Kitchen. Due to the spread of invasive insects, we ask that you DO NOT BRING FIREWOOD unless it is store-bought/kiln dried. We have bundles for sale here for $5/bundle (bring cash) or you can scavenge dead wood from the forest floor for free. DO NOT cut down live trees and DO NOT burn plastic, glass, trash, gas, or anything that isn‚Äôt wood or paper. There is plenty of fire-starting materials under the Pavilion next to the bundles. On your way to the farm, you will pass the local fire department. Please make note of the fire danger sign. If the fire danger is high, a campfire may not be advisable ‚Äì please check for local burn bans.\n\nSMOKING: Smoking is not permitted within the vicinity of any building on the farm. Please do not discard cigarette butts in the firepits or on the ground. They must be completely extinguished and can be thrown in the trash.\n\nTRASH: In case you missed it before, we do not have trash pick-up on the farm and very much appreciate it if you can take your trash with you when you leave the farm. We do have recycling bins for clean plastic and aluminum cans. Paper and cardboard can be put in the box next to the firewood bundles under the pavilion for others to use for starting fires. We also have a compost bin available for all food scraps, paper napkins, and paper plates. Please do not discard food on the ground as it can make our animals sick and attract unwanted wildlife.\n\nMOTORIZED VEHICLES: We do not allow ATVs, 4-wheelers, golf carts, or any non-medical motorized transportation. Bicycles are welcome and encouraged.\n\nGENERATORS: We highly discourage the use of generators as they can be quite noisy and produce toxic fumes. Please talk to us in advance if you require one for a specific purpose.\n\nACCIDENTS: If a child or member of your party has an accident involving bodily fluids, please take the time to clean up after them. First aid kits are supplied in most rentals and in the Community Kitchen. If bedding is involved, we have coin-operated laundry facilities in the Community building to begin the washing process. Please notify us of such events.\n\nCOOLERS & CANDLES: Coolers should be left outside so that the condensation doesn't damage our floors. Candles are not allowed due to too many wax spills.\n\nNEARBY: We are just 8 miles from the Berea Pinnacles, 6 miles from Get Outside Ky (they rent canoes, kayaks, SUPs, and e-bikes), 3 miles to Tater Knob Pottery, 20 minutes to Anglin Falls, and a scenic hour from Red River Gorge. Berea is known for its arts and crafts, the historic Berea College, and outdoor recreation. In addition to hiking at the Pinnacles, there are several other trails throughout town and the newly opened Silver Creek Bike Park.\n\nNOMS: Our favorite places to eat in Berea are Noodle Nirvana, Native Bagel Company, Happy Jack‚Äôs World Sandwich Bar, Nightjar, Apollo Pizza, PapaLeno‚Äôs, and El Rio Grande. In Richmond, we like Masala Indian, Purdy‚Äôs Coffee Co., and Thai Smile.

Augusta is also home to underground railroad.\n\nAnother favorite for more fine dining right on the river is the Beehive.

Find a place to eat along the river. You can take bridge back to Maysville and visit their historical downtown. Eat at Parc Cafe-A Italian cafe replica or at the five star LILJUMBO cafe\n\nFor quick bite to eat order a Pizza from the Germantown 1st stop Gas station 4 miles and pick it up. Phone number is in the treehouse or order from Snappy\'s in Brooksville and they will now deliver as far as 3 miles from tree house by Palmer funeral home at beginning of 875\n\n\nBack story. The Tree houses are our dream come true. We both wanted treehouses at a young age. For me being in nature brings me peace. When I was 9 I would play in the woods with my siblings and build my tree house with small branches, using rocks as our furniture and moss as our carpet. I never let go of having this space and thought about it often.\n\nWhen Bill and I started our dream company EarthJOY Tree adventures in 2007. Whereas we take clients to the top of trees on ropes. As part of this venture we wanted to give them another experience. Why not be able to stay in a treehouse too??\n\nWe set off to take Pete Nelsons LEARN HOW TO BUILD A TREEHOUSE in 2009 workshop.\n\nAfter the workshop we looked high and low for the perfect property to have this dream come true. We ran into many obstacles one being not able to afford it or not the right trees.\n\nWhen we saw Pete on Animal planet I thought I would just apply for the fun of it. We didn\'t even have a place. When they called and accepted our application I called Dad. I asked him if we could build a treehouse on his 200 acre farm. He laughed and then said YES! He said he was tired of running two farms and would now change gears to have a few tree houses.\n\nIn 2017 we built our second tree house. This one you are reading about!\n\nIN 2019 we finished our third tree house built by Bill ~ co-owner and my husband. He put love into every single nail and board. It is unique in that it has play elements like a slide, 2 swings and double loft. He made 50% of the tree house from the land itself using cedars and re-purposed wood and roof from one of the old farmhouses .\n\n\n\n*** Important *** No RESCHEDULES or CANCELLATIONS within 30 days of your stay! This is a strict policy! As a small business, we are no longer able to accept cancels or reschedules unless it is a death in the immediate family!

The hand-crafted Magical Jungle Tree House is one of 3 casitas and 2 treehouses at the Bio Thermales natural resort organically integrated into our 35 acre rainforest. Guests enjoy free 24 hour access to the 12 natural hot and cool springs pools of various temperatures and rainforest trails.', 'The space', 'The space\nThe Magical Jungle Tree House is handcrafted with many artistic wood work and furniture, a tile bathroom with a flash on-demand water heater for the shower, and a nicely laid out and well equipped kitchen. It is set back a bit in the rainforest, but still close to the hot and cool springs. The balcony almost completely surrounds the tree house.\n\nOur hot springs are ancient ‚Äúdeep Earth‚Äù sources that bubble up through the rainforest floor, laden with mineral-rich waters that have been in the Earth for at least 10,000 years. Our waters are rich in bicarbonates, calcium and magnesium, low in sulfur, and slightly acidic -- qualities shared by many of the world\'s best hot springs.\n\nFive of our 9 organic form hot springs pools are located in the rainforest, and 4 hot springs pools as well as a small and a large cool spring swimming pool are located in a meadow, surrounded by rainforest (see below for more information). The small and large cool springs pools both have water slides, and there is a small water slide in one of the shallow and moderate temperature pools for small children.\n\nNote on wifi -- we have a fiber optic cable to the main office that is about 98% reliable, but had to install repeaters to bring wifi signal to the casitas and tree houses. The repeaters are not as reliable, especially in bad weather. However, we can help you send or receive email one way or another via the fiber optic cable.\n\nThe Treehouse is built to strict Costa Rican building codes.\n\nTo see all our listings, including the Colibri Casita3, please go to https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/54000 and on the left side of the page three listings will show. At the bottom of them, click on ‚ÄúView all listings‚Äù to see all 5 listings.\n\nYou can check availability of each accommodation by clicking on the ""Calendar"" tab above the main photo on each listing.\n\nTreehouse features: (see floor-plan for all details):\n‚Ä¢ Perched high among the rainforest trees, the Tree House has large screened areas for circulation of naturally cooler breezes. It also has fans.\n‚Ä¢ All onsite hot springs and recreation activities included, including 24 hour access to the hot springs and cool spring swimming pools\n‚Ä¢ The Treehouse2 is all on one floor, with a Queen sized bed with orthopedic mattress and hypoallergenic bedding.\n‚Ä¢ There is also a twin-sized bed that can double a a settee with hypoallergenic bedding\n‚Ä¢ Hand-crafted rustic furniture from naturally harvested trees on the land\n‚Ä¢ Main floor kitchen with refrigerator, micro-wave, rice-cooker, coffee maker, basic kitchenware\n‚Ä¢ Bathroom with flash on-demand hot-water heater\n‚Ä¢ Wrap around balcony for relaxing and animal and bird watching\n‚Ä¢ Laundry service at $5 charge per load\n‚Ä¢ Short walk to rainforest and hot springs pools\n‚Ä¢ No telephone or television\n‚Ä¢ WiFi internet for your laptop -- if reliable 24 hour internet is essential to you, please message us for suggestions.\n‚Ä¢ Hosts Kathy and Bernie live onsite\n‚Ä¢ Languages: English, Spanish, German\nOne time $10 cleaning fee; thereafter housecleaning services every 3 days are free.\nBio Thermales Hot Springs features:\n‚Ä¢ Our hot springs pools are all-natural mineral water just as it flows from the Earth\n‚Ä¢ Rainforest Pools from 90¬∞ - 102¬∞F (31¬∞ - 40¬∞C)\n‚Ä¢ Grotto Pools in meadow flow from the 104¬∞F/42¬∞C source pool onward into two larger and progressively cooler pools which are handicap-accessible and suitable for small children.\n‚Ä¢ Cool Pool in meadow is 90¬∞F/31¬∞C mineral water flowing from the thermal creek\n‚Ä¢ 2 Swimming pools with continuous flow of natural cold spring water (88 degrees) - one is 1 to 1.5 meters deep, and the larger is 1.6 meters deep.\n‚Ä¢ Bathhouse in meadow with handicap accessible bathrooms and showers\n‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúRanchos‚Äù ‚Äì roofed tables with concrete floors and grills for picnics\nOther Activities on our 35 acre rainforest reserve:\n‚Ä¢ Bird-watching: many types of toucans, oropendulas, parrots, hummingbirds, and the rare green macaw\n‚Ä¢ Rainforest: enjoy it from the casita porch or hot springs pools, take easy walks on paths or more adventurous hikes\n‚Ä¢ Fossils ‚Äì enjoy our collection or hunt (gently) for your own\n‚Ä¢ Wildlife: two-toed sloths, iguanas, capuchin and mantled howler monkeys, tree frogs, birds, butterflies, and many others.\n\nWe are a 45 minute drive from the many activities in Fortuna and Volcano Arenal -- such as ziplines, hanging bridges, white water rafting, slow river floats or kayaking through wildlife sanctuaries -- or a 1.5 hour drive to La Paz Waterfall Gardens and Volcano Poas.\n\nBio Thermales Hot Springs is open to the public for day use of the hot springs, and most of our day visitors are Costa Ricans, so you may also meet new Tico friends. Bio Thermales is generally not crowded, however, except on major holidays and Sundays.\n\nFood/Meals: The Tree House has a kitchen. There are many restaurants and a good supermarket within a 15 minute drive. Traditional Costa Rican meals can be delivered from a local caterer for very reasonable prices (Costa Rican food is tasty but not spicy). Otherwise, for those without cars, we can call a taxi or try to synchronize a food shopping trip when we go to town for errands.\n\nThree hours of daylight are needed to safely drive here from the SJO airport before sunset at 5:30 pm. The drive through mountainous cloud forests is splendid in daylight, but prone to fog and rain, especially at night, creating hazardous visibility conditions after dark. Finding our countryside location will also be far easier if you arrive the first time before sunset. If your plane lands in the morning to noon at SJO airport ‚Äì or 11:00 am at Liberia airport -- you can drive here directly from the airport. Otherwise, it is safer to book a room near the airport on your first night, or ask us to book a private driver and have a rental car delivered at no extra charge.\n\nLast night in Costa Rica:\nDriving directly to the airport on the same day is possible if you book a flight in the afternoon. Please be aware that you must be at the airport 2.5 hours before departure. If you have an early morning departing flight it is basically necessary to stay near the airport on the night before.', 'Guest access', 'Guest access\nGuests enjoy free access to the hot springs, swimming pools and rainforest trails from 9 am to 10 pm.\n\nLaundry: we have a full laundry facility and we will do laundry for $5 per load (wash, dry and fold).', 'Other things to note', 'Other things to note\nDay visitors and groups are permitted entrance to use the hot springs and cool springs pools from 9 am to 6 pm. There are usually more day visitors on weekends, especially Sundays, and we recommend booking week days for more tranquility and privacy. If guests book a longer reservation that includes a Sunday, we recommend planning a day tour in the many nearby activities on Sundays. Day visitors must leave by 6 pm, and only casita and Tree House guests may use the pools after 6 pm and enjoy unlimited access to the pools, with the exception of no nighttime use of the forest pools, and cleaning schedule as noted above.\n\nWe recommend either ordering a catered dinner in advance for your first evening and/or next morning breakfast, or buying and bringing groceries to cook because we are 4 km from the main paved road and driving after dark is highly discouraged until drivers have quite some experience on Costa Rican roads. Also, most guests prefer to settle in upon arrival and not to have to get back in the car and drive out to dinner. We provide a Catering Menu to each guest once reserved, but the caterer requires advance notice of selected meals and TIMES guests would like meals delivered. We do not have a liquor license and guests must bring their own beer/wine/rum etc. The tap water is safe to drink, and we sell soft drinks, fruit juices, and other non-alcohol beverages, snacks and ice cream.']","['What this place offers', 'Bathroom', 'Shampoo', 'Hot water', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Washing machine', 'Dryer', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Hangers', 'Home safety', 'Fire extinguisher', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Dedicated workspace', 'A desk or table with a chair and space for a laptop.', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Refrigerator', 'Microwave', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Stove', 'Coffee maker', 'Location features', 'Private entrance', 'Separate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor', 'Patio or balcony', 'Garden', 'An open space on the property usually covered in grass', 'BBQ grill', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Pool', 'Services', 'Luggage drop-off allowed', ""For guests' convenience when they are arriving early or departing late"", 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Host greets you', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: TV\nTV', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Hair dryer\nHair dryer', 'Unavailable: Smoke alarm\nSmoke alarm', 'This place may not have a smoke detector.

Only us crazy people live here. This is the furthest place from a resort and you will quite possibly be just as far away from your neighbor. There are no restaurants, shops or even an office to greet you when first arriving, you are completely on your own in the middle of one of the most biologically diverse places on the planet.\n\nThat said, if you want to experience the jungle in its raw form, see something that may scare you, get hot and sweaty exploring the trails before cooling off in the rivers or under the waterfall while spotting wildlife in its natural habitat, then this is paradise.\n\n\nWHAT ABOUT COVID-19\n\nWhat about it - social distancing is not an issue here. Residents' lives didn't change one bit (other than they grew more stuff to eat). If anything, their lifestyle choice was reinforced and while sympathetic with the world, they appreciated their everyday lives even more. If you are looking for a vacation without having to be reminded about the pandemic - then this is the perfect place!\n\n\nWHY ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF RENTALS AVAILABLE AT FINCA BELLAVISTA?\n\nSadly, the former property management company shut down in early 2020. As the homes are privately owned, a selection of owners have got together to offer rentals privately in order to keep the spirit of Finca Bellavista alive and some of the previous employees with work (they offer services independently). Almost all employees have worked at least a decade at the community and no one knows the property better.\n\n\nMEET AND GREET\n\nFormer Finca Bellavista employees Jesus and Francis will make sure you get to your rental hassle free. Once a booking is confirmed, you will be put in touch with Francis who will help prepare for your arrival.

They also store carbon, offsetting harmful byproducts of fossil-fuel burning.\nThey moderate the effects of sun and wind, and they clean the air by trapping dust, pollen and other pollutants.\nPlanted in the right places around buildings, trees can significantly reduce air-conditioning costs. This means less Freon, an inflammable and odorless chemical emitted from air conditioners. It is considered to have damaging effects to the ozone layer.\nTrees increase property value.\nTrees generate jobs and contribute raw materials for buildings, newspapers, books, etc. They are renewable, biodegradable and recyclable.\nThey provide shelter and food for wildlife such as birds, squirrels and bugs.\nTrees make people feel good. Workers are more productive when they see trees along their commute routes and from their office windows.\nLandscapes that include trees help relax us, lower heart rates and reduce stress.']","['What this place offers', 'Bathroom', 'Bath', 'Hair dryer', 'Shampoo', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Washing machine', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Hangers', 'Iron', 'Entertainment', 'TV with standard cable/satellite', 'Suitable for events', 'The listing can accommodate a gathering of 25 or more attendees', 'Family', 'Children‚Äôs tableware', 'Window guards', 'Table corner guards', 'Heating and cooling', 'Air conditioning', 'Heating', 'Home safety', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Dedicated workspace', 'A desk or table with a chair and space for a laptop.', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Stove', 'Coffee maker', 'Location features', 'Lake access', 'Guests can get to a lake using a path or dock', 'Resort access', 'Guests can use nearby resort facilities', 'Outdoor', 'Fire pit', 'Outdoor furniture', 'Outdoor dining area', 'Outdoor kitchen', 'BBQ grill', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Free on-street parking', 'Private hot tub', 'Lift', 'The home or building has a lift that‚Äôs at least 52 inches (132cm) deep and a doorway at least 32 inches (81cm) wide.', 'EV charger', 'Guests can charge their electric vehicles on the property.', 'Gym', 'Services', 'Pets allowed', 'Assistance animals are always allowed', 'Breakfast', 'Breakfast is provided', 'Self check-in', 'Building staff', 'Someone is available 24 hours a day to let guests in', 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Private entrance\nPrivate entrance']",Ponova Vas Grosuplje Slovenia,4,2,1,117,,,,,,,43,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/4474355?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A8188&children=0&infants=0&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2022-03-25&check_out=2022-04-01&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=eebf9d56-f119-426a-b39b-9d89928069dc,1,

Wake up to the sight of the magnificent ""Blue Ridge Mountains"" and the town of Luray, VA from 1,500 feet.', 'The space', 'The space\nWe debated long and hard whether to list this place on airbnb.

But because we love it so much, and in the spirit of the sharing economy, we felt compelled to open its doors to others and allow you to experience the wonderful warmth that this small and rustic cabin will bring to your soul, your heart and your sight. While here, every sense is lifted, every smell improved, every sound a symphony.\n\nIf you\'re looking for modern comfort and the latest gadgets, this is not your place. Instead, if you want to warm yourself up, you\'ll need to place wood in the stove. If you want to check the latest stock prices, you\'ll need to call your broker because Internet is NOT available. If you want to watch TV in your room, please look elsewhere.\n\nHowever, if you prefer to wake up to the most extraordinary sunrise in your life, simply sleep on the futon couch and open up your eyes in the early morning. If you find delight while hearing the buzz of a hummingbird, just place a few seeds in the balcony. If you want to reconnect with your inner self, seat in one of the shaker rocking chairs, pull up your legs and open that book you always wanted to complete. If you\'re lucky, you may even see a black bear or two roaming around (no worries, they are not dangerous).\n\nThe Cabin is located at about 1,500 feet overlooking the Shenandoah River, the town of Luray, and the ""Blue Ridge Mountains.""

Go horse back riding. Explore the Virginia wine country. Or just...relax.\n\nWelcome to a place where time has finally slowed down!', '', '', 'Other things to note', 'Other things to note\nQ & A:\n\nQ: Why do you rent this place?\nA: We use it one month per year at most. Why keep this jewel to ourselves? Please enjoy it as if it\'s your place as well.\n\nQ: Why is there no Internet?\nA: I work in the high-tech sector. I am connected 24/7. I wanted a place where time stands still, be close to nature, and could truly get away from it all. We want to share not only the place, but the experience as well.\n\nQ: What if I need something from you?\nA: Just send me a text message or give me a ring. You\'ll get my number after your booking is confirmed.\n\nQ: The fridge is very small, will we starve to death?\nA: Hey, no drama here. Yes, the fridge is small, but there is also an ice cooler you may use. Simply bring your own ice and please drain it before leaving. That should keep you alive for a bit longer :-)\n\nQ: Should I bring sheets and towels?\nA: No worries. We will provide bedding and towels, blankets, soap, shampoo and toilet paper. If you need anything else, please let me know and I will do anything in my power to have it ready before your arrival.\n\nQ. Nice wood stove, do I can have to purchase firewood?\nA. No need to do so. I usually provide plenty of firewood for my guests. You may find it in the back deck. Please cover the wood with the tarp after you\'re done to protect it from the rain and allow other guests to warm themselves too :-)\n\nQ: I love this place, can I extend my stay?\nA: If available, sure, knock yourself out. Simply get to an internet cafe or use your smart phone and book again. But please contact me beforehand out of courtesy.\n\nQ: Great decoration, what style is it?\nA: Shaker style. From wikipedia, ""Shaker furniture is a distinctive style of furniture developed by the United Society of Believers in Christ\'s Second Appearing, commonly known as Shakers, a religious sect that had guiding principles of simplicity, utility and honesty. Their beliefs were reflected in the well-made furniture of minimalist designs."" We are not shakers, but we are guided by the same principles.\n\nQ. What\'s the sleeping situation?\nA. Well, you\'re welcome to sleep any way you\'d like :-) But to be more specific, there are two bedrooms, both with full-size beds. One bedroom has a platform bed with a memory foam mattress, and the other one a Murphy bed with a memory foam topper. There are also two full-size futons located next to the stove in the living room. If you\'re not into futons, there is also a comfy inflatable full-size bed found in the closet where the Murphy bed is. Please take your pick.\n\nQ. There are no bathroom faucets!\nA. Mmm, that wasn\'t a question, but yes they\'re there. These faucets and vanity were a DIY project of my own design using copper piping and shut-off valves and reclaimed wood. Just turn the valves one quarter of the way counterclockwise to open the water supply. Pretty cool, hugh?\n\nQ. Is the Cabin self-sustainable?\nA. Not yet, but I\'m working on it. With your booking contribution, I created a system to capture rain water to the cistern below (the mountain is dry and water is a precious commodity here), and eventually I will install solar panels on the roof. Currently, all waste water goes into a septic tank, so as soon as I implement the above steps, the Cabin will technically be able to be off-grid.\n\nQ. What other environmental measures have you implemented?\nA. In addition to capturing water from rain and eventually energy from the sun, I have renovated the bathroom and kitchen using reclaimed wood, some of it from a nearby old farm. The dish and body soaps and most house-cleaning products are environmentally-friendly to help natural decomposition of waste water in the septic system. The floor is made up of natural cork and wood, and the entire place was recently re-insulated to improve energy efficiency. If you\'d like to know more about our eco-efforts, please contact me.\n\nQ. Why are there so many water jugs in the kitchen?\nA. Drinking water in colorful jugs, as well as the 5-gal dispenser just outside the kitchen, comes from a nearby natural water spring (best tasting water I ever had). I leave plenty of it for you because TAP water is NOT potable. In fact, I ask my guests to be mindful of tap water usage because there is no well or city-piped water source. Instead, water is collected to a cistern below from rain or trucked in (by me) if need be. It is therefore a precious commodity. Simply shut off faucets when not in use, be careful not to leave the toilet running, and take shorter showers if possible. That\'s it! :-)\n\nQ. How is the house heated?\nA. The main source of heat is the wood stove. You\'ll be surprise how efficient this rustic appliance is. Depending on the temp, it may take a couple of hours to bring the thermometer up to your standard, so exercise a little patience. There is a heat-infused fan and a tea pot on top of the stove. The fan will propagate the heat efficiently and the tea pot (with water) will act as a natural humidifier, making you more comfortable. In addition, there is a wall heater in the kitchen (dial) and another one in the bathroom (switch) that you can control. Finally, a baseboard heater in the entrance hallway will keep the bedrooms (and water pipes) warm. In short, you\'ll be cozy!\n\nQ. OK, so I will be warm in winter. What about the height of the summer heat?\nA. Oh, you\'ll will be warm in summer alright :-) But seriously, there is an old and fairly inefficient AC wall unit in the dining room. There is also a ceiling fan in the living room and another one in one of the bedrooms. I\'ve found that opening the windows creates a nice airflow that cools the place down. But if you\'re looking for a in-house refrigerator, this small cabin may not be for you.\n\nQ. What\'s the deal with you being a Superhost?\nA. Well then, since you ask...I\'m a Superhost because we\'re relaxed about our guests despite us having full-time jobs of our own. However, I\'ve come to be rather fond of that ""title,"" and I don\'t appreciate when a guest leaves a review saying that the place was too isolated, or that the place was not what they expected (there\'s only about 40 pictures).

Nestled among numerous fruit trees is The PGBT tree house sturdily affixed in a mango tree Fifty feet above the river.The Tree house is 30ft. x30ft. with two loft‚Äôs ,with king and queen beds, Kitchen , Bar&large Dining room table seating eight persons with plenty of elbow room &a large bathroom.A private bed room with queen size bed, and private bathroom.', 'The space', 'The space\nA Veranda with table for two in an intimate setting overlooking the river below. Opposite side of the tree house is a table overlooking the river below and mountains above which can seat eight.Fruits are available to our guests when in season. Pick mangos from inside the tree house. The rope bridge (160ft) supported steel cables and one inch ropes leading to the tree house entrance.The spectacular view is very therapeutic; the sound of the river is music to the soul.\nA History\nA huge mango tree, beckoned me to come build a tree house on its huge branches. The tree bordered a river overlooking a mountain range. I took the challenge!!!!!! I built the frame on the ground using 4x4‚Äôs, sandwiched by2x6‚Äôs, 20 feet long, bolted together. Workers pulled up the 20 feet by hand 50 feet above the ground. The beams were put onto the huge branches and bolted together. I used primitive tools with no level or square. The support beams below were sturdy and strong. Chains holding up the tree house from above adding even more support which made the uneven slanted tree house, strong and sturdy .To keep the weight to a minimum the lightest material available was used, every scraps found a place.No lumber was wasted. I kept building, adding on the 20 ft. frame. Verandas were added making the tree house a huge 30ft by 30 feet. The sides of the tree house were left open for the wind to blow through.Being 50 feet above the ground meant no peeping Toms to worry about.The tree house took years to build and it is still being worked on. Good better best, never let it rest, until the good is better, and the better best. I am a perfectionist, we never seem to finish, we just run out of time.\n\nThe PGBT Tree house was designed and built by a Vietnam Veteran who served with the 173rd.

They are a rural haven for visitors but only 10 minutes from Petersfield, with fantastic road and rail connections for London and Portsmouth. This description is for Stable Cottage. Please see our other adverts for photos and description of Rose Cottage, Edward's Cottage and Louisa's Cottage.\n\nThe four holiday homes would suit large groups and families looking to holiday together. Please ask your host, Venetia, for more information.\n\nOur small working farm, Downlands Farm, on which the self-catering cottages are set, is just off a green-lane which leads to miles of footpaths, bridleways and on and off-road cycling.\n\nPets are welcome at Stable Cottage, please enquire upon booking.\n\nThere are three excellent pubs surrounding the farm, all within a half hour stroll or a 3 minute car journey. The quaint and bustling market town of Petersfield is a 10 minute drive from the farm and alongside the two local village shops, these all provide a perfect base for stocking up on essential items. The larger, cathedral cities of Chichester, Guildford, Portsmouth and Winchester are all equally 45 minutes away, offering great shopping and entertainment.\n\nWe are so lucky to be within an hour‚Äôs drive from one of the premier Blue Flag beaches in the country, West Wittering. West Wittering is a beautiful place to visit, whatever the season, and can be enjoyed by all ages. During the low season (October to April), horse riding is permitted at any time during the day on West Wittering and the summer months offer horseriding before 9am and after 6pm. Hayling Island, a shingle beach (with funfair for the children!) is half an hour from Downlands Farm.\n\nStable Cottage offers light and airy accommodation with two ground floor bedrooms and a huge playroom/bedroom upstairs.\n\nAfter stowing muddy wellies in the under-cover porch, you will walk into our bright, well equipped kitchen / dining / sitting room. Stretching the entire width of the barn, this large room opens out through French windows onto your own private terrace and garden complete with garden tables and chairs.\n\nA television with BT Vision and Netflix will keep you entertained on those horrible rainy days. It goes without saying that guests have use of free Wifi.\n\nA utility room with washing machine and tumble dryer leads off from the kitchen which in turn leads to a well ventilated shower room.\n\nTwo double bedrooms also lead off from the kitchen, the master bedroom having an ensuite bathroom with a large bathtub perfect for soaking after a long walk. Both bedrooms have televisions.\n\nChildren will absolutely love their playroom at the top of the property. Accessed by stairs from the sitting room, children will have their own space to create chaos and noise. There is ample space up here to accommodate up to four additional people - two single beds and one double bed.\n\nThere is no extra charge for use of a travel cot, stair gate and high chair as required. Please contact us for information and to discuss your requirements.\n\nWe welcome guests who wish to stay for a minimum of two nights up to a maximum of one month.\n\nPlease note, Stable Cottage, Rose Cottage, Edward's Cottage and Louisa's Cottage are situated on a working farm and next door to horse stables. Whilst the interior of the properties is beautiful, we would like to make it clear that, at present, the exterior is still a work in progress.

We have produced a Risk Assessment that covers all aspects of our business. This can be seen upon request.\n\nCheck-out times: Strictly 4pm arrival, 10am departure.\n\nEntertainment: We unfortunately have had to remove all toys, board games, books, magazines and tourist leaflets as we cannot disinfect every item. There is a ping pong table and pool table in the ‚Äògames room‚Äô within the barn. This room is cleaned regularly but it would be great if you could help us by using the disposable paper towel and spray provided to wipe down any equipment after use.\n\nIf one of your party develops symptoms: while staying with us, Government advice is to get tested immediately and for the group to self isolate in situ. Should the test come back positive before the scheduled end of the stay then the group is required to immediately return to their primary residence(s) and continue to self isolate for the required time. Please let us know as our cleaning protocols are different in this scenario. The symptoms to look out for are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. Regardless of the test result, if you are too unwell to return home and decide to self isolate in your cottage beyond your scheduled stay, then you will be liable for all fees for all bookings affected by this self isolation.\nNeedless to say, if one of your party develops symptoms in the days prior to your scheduled stay with us, please follow Government guidance ‚Äì self isolate, get tested, and do not travel.\nThank you for your help and understanding.

In the dead of night you will hear the owls hooting and the dawn chorus of the numerous birds will greet you at day break.\n\nThe area has many excellent pubs, some of which are over 500 years old.

This is to cover the Sanitisation Clean only and guests are still required to clean up after themselves during their stay. Cleaning products are provided.\n\n* Please Note - For hygiene reasons, we don't provide any linens/ bedding, including bed sheets, pillows, duvets and towels (+ tea towels & cleaning cloths).

We've also been able to work remotely here as the connection is strong enough to support video calls.\n\nWe also have a large supply of DVDs and books in the cabin for cold or wet days that you might not want to go out - so stay in and curl up on our big sofas!"", 'Guest access', ""Guest access\nThe place is all yours during your stay and in addition to this there's a small shop, launderette (great after a day mountain biking or hill walking) & well equipped playground on site.

As it's Grade II listed though, this is taking some time to get sorted.\nWe can recommend alternative venues and taxis. Please ask us for more info or check the guidebook at the Cabin.\n\nLarger shops / supermarkets and all tourist attractions are accessible by car.

The interior has been sympathetically restored to reflect the period it was built, comprising of mid-century fittings, furniture and original posters.\n\nThe house consists of one double bedroom and a shower room. The open plan living space comprises of a kitchen with a breakfast bar, a dining area, a large settee, a TV and DVD player, and a wood-burning stove. There is also a utility room with a washer/dryer.\n\nExternally the house consists of a private unheated swimming pool surrounded by cedar decking, several seated tables including what was part of an old stone cider press and also a large table near the shade of two ancient apple trees; a perfect place to eat outside or just admire the view. The house is set in grounds shared by the owner, but is discretely tucked away.\n\nThe pool will be open from April 1st.\n\nRodborough Common, set in open grassland on the Cotswold escarpment, commands impressive views of Stroud and the Severn Vale. In the summer cattle roam free, often wandering across roads. In the rambling 19th century golf course it is not uncommon to see cattle blocking golfers as they try to take shots. To admire the view visit The Lodge pub in the middle of the common, or have an ice cream at Winstones Cotswold Ice Cream factory.\n\nIn the village of Rodborough is the pub The Prince Albert; a couple of minutes walk from the Poolhouse, The Albert is a busy, characterful pub that has regular music nights with musicians of repute as well as comedy nights.\n\nThe house is a mile from the small bustling market town of Stroud with its independent shops, pubs and caf√©s.

The surrounding Cotswolds‚Äô also has a wealth of houses and gardens open to the public.\n\nWalkers can access the famous Cotswold Way, 102 miles along the Cotswold escarpment, stretching from Chipping Campden to Bath with sweeping views and passing through picturesque villages in Cotswold stone.\n\nFurther afield the city of Bath and the city of Bristol are both a 45-minute drive away.\n\nTransport links: Stroud train station is less than a mile away; there are hourly trains to London, Gloucester and Cheltenham. Paddington is 90 minutes away by train.\n\nThe house would be ideally suited to a couple.

1e308ef0-d2a6-4563-a105-3bfb693c09ac,Amazing pools,The Shed,"['About this space', 'The Property:\n\nThe Shed is named somewhat tongue in cheek by the owners\' family as it is about as far from a shed as you can get. Whether sitting out on the decking with its clear view glass balustrade or in the comfort of the lounge you have stunning views across Avon Beach and the Solent to the Isle of Wight and The Needles; there is always something to watch at any time of year. When you talk about a property one of the most important factors is location. New for 2015, the chalet has it all from its prime sea front position to its proximity to such places as the beautiful New Forest, Bournemouth, Lymington and Christchurch. There is so much to do right on your doorstep or within a very short drive.\n\nThe Shed is fully equipped to a high standard with all you need to make your stay one of comfort and luxury. There is a dishwasher ""so no arguments over the washing up!"", separate fridge and freezer, microwave and extra touches like a built in coffee maker, Bose Sounddock and TVs in both bedrooms. You have private parking adjacent to the chalet so you do not have to haul your luggage and shopping far.\n\nThe Shed is based within the boutique Sandhills Holiday Park. With its historic main house and leafy grounds the whole ambiance is one of relaxing in the country but with the sights and sounds of the sea. The park facilities are available to all guests and include an adventure playground, family bar with Sky TV, heated outdoor pool, small gymnasium, pool table, launderette and mini mart store. Additionally there is free WiFi in the lounge and bar areas.\nAbout the Local area:\nChristchurch was a renowned smuggling town and \'The Shed\' is just a short walk from the historic Mudeford Quay where in 1784 smugglers skirmished with Customs and Excise officers. So kids bring those cutlasses, eye patches and skull and crossbones, oh and a parrot if you have one!\n\nIt is still a working quay today with fishing boats venturing out most days so why not say hello to Pete on boat Deja Vu (SU21) and see how his day has been, or wave to him from your decking as he heads back from another successful day out. If you fancy testing your skills out and bringing the catch home yourself pleasure fishing trips are available directly from the quay, or we can help you organise in advance. There are many pleasure trips to be had or if you fancy a thrill then why not hang on to your seats on the Bay Blast rib ride.\n\nThe Quay is also famous for its crabbing from the quayside (crabbers quay!) and has a children\'s play park, fish stall, cafe, The Haven House Inn and a large green area which is perfect for picnics, ball games and kite flying. You can catch the ferry to Hengistbury Head directly from the Quay and visit its fantastic beaches and beach huts.\n\nChristchurch harbour is a great place for watersports from windsurfing to sailing and the Highcliffe sailing club is based on the Quay. There is also an active RNLI lifeboat station which practices launching weekly so you are almost bound to see their rather unusual lifeboat launch and recovery system in action!\n\nIf walking or bird watching is your thing then you can do both without even getting in the car. Within an easy stroll you will find a nature reserve on the cliff top adjacent to Highcliffe Castle. If you fancy a little longer out then why not try the circular walk through Stanpit Marshes and on to Christchurch for a spot of lunch. Then take the Tuckton ferry from outside the Captains Club to cross the river, or walk over Tuckton bridge a little further on if the ferry is not running, and head across more picturesque marshes to the back of Hengistbury Head. From there you can skirt the inside shoreline, head up and over the top or use the beach as your route back to the beach huts and ferry home at the tip of the Head. Who knows, the Haven House Inn may tempt you with a thirst quencher before heading back to the luxuries of the chalet.\n\nDown at Avon beach, there is a caf√©/restaurant, the Noisy Lobster, and kiosks serving fish and chips, coffee and ice cream. There is a shop selling anything from local/national papers to clothes and holiday souvenirs and even a bakery on site.\n\nIf you head out in the car then the walks available to you are endless with The New Forest on your doorstep and The Purbecks within easy reach. Easily missed and of particular note is the area around Keyhaven and Lymington and, in particular, the sea wall walk past the now disused salt works and the spit and Hurst Castle, which in itself is worth entry but make sure you have a few hours to spare.\n\nHistorically sailing and fishing are all part of the local heritage with such famous local sailing clubs as Christchurch and Lymington to hand. More recently wind and kite surfing have become extremely popular along with kayaking and paddle boarding. Don\'t worry if you have never tried any of these or do not have any equipment as Shore Sports base themselves in the harbour and are more than happy to help out.\n\nAbout the area in general:\n\nChristchurch - the sign says \'Where Time is Pleasant\' and it\'s right. From the lively Monday market to the great shops and restaurants along the high street it is a great coastal town. It is a short trip in the car or by the Ferry that leaves from Mudeford Quay. Christchurch Priory is the longest parish church in the country and is surrounded by beautiful grounds, riverside walks and Christchurch Quay. The Priory is a must see and is steeped in history. The Priory contains the \'miraculous beam\' said to be placed there by a carpenter locals believed was Christ himself.\n\nThe New Forest - a National Park situated on the south coast of England. The landscape is a mix of heathland, grassland, bogs and woods. Domestic animals are permitted to roam freely throughout the Forest. Visit Beaulieu Motor Museum, catch a ferry from the pretty town of Lymington to the Isle of Wight or just enjoy the many cycle trails, walks and forest villages.\n\nBournemouth - the famous seaside resort with miles of beaches, loads of restaurants, bars, clubs and great shopping. Just 9 miles away, it has so much to see and do.\n\nOther Attractions - Alice in Wonderland maze Theme Park, Serendipity Sams, Go Ape at Moors Valley, TowerPark with its Multiplex Bowling and Splashdown Indoor Water Park, Paulton\'s theme park on the edge of the New Forest, the Bournemouth Oceanarium, Compton Acres, Poole Old Town & Harbour, Sandbanks and Brownsea Island to name but a few.', 'Guest access', 'Guest access\nGuests have full access to the full property along with access to the Sandhills Holiday Park site facilities']","['What this place offers', 'Bathroom', 'Bath', 'Hair dryer', 'Hot water', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Washing machine', 'Dryer', 'Hangers', 'Bed linen', 'Iron', 'Entertainment', 'TV', 'Heating and cooling', 'Heating', 'Home safety', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Refrigerator', 'Microwave', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Dishwasher', 'Oven', 'Coffee maker', 'Location features', 'Waterfront', 'Right next to a body of water', 'Beach access ‚Äì Beachfront', 'Guests can enjoy a nearby beach', 'Outdoor', 'Patio or balcony', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Pool', 'Single level home', 'No stairs in home', 'Services', 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Essentials\nEssentials', 'Unavailable: Shampoo\nShampoo', 'Unavailable: Private entrance\nPrivate entrance']",Christchurch Mudeford United Kingdom,4,2,2,251,5,5,5,5,5,4.8,30,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/32761043?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A677&children=0&infants=0&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2022-10-14&check_out=2022-10-21&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=0b044c1c-8d17-4b03-bffb-5de13ff710bc,2,

The site has seven separate and unique, boutique-style treehouses to suit a variance of moods, lending itself to different styles and tastes, and is located within a magical, peaceful woodland setting on acres of Oxfordshire's woodland. Designed to be seamlessly placed within the wider natural surroundings, it is possible to catch a glimpse of local deer and other wildlife from the raised deck of the treehouse.\n\nLike all of the dwellings on the impressive site, Kanna is built from an eco-conscious perspective. It is a non-traditional, visually striking treehouse on an equally impressive site at Treedwellers Finstock.

An exterior, front-facing deck offers outdoor space and a lookout spot to breathe in all that the acres of spaces of the woodlands beyond.\n\nThe interior is a unique blend of contemporary design that creates a thoroughly modern, minimalist feeling to what the owners hope will be a timeless and welcoming space.

Staying at the Conker allows you to enjoy the the escapism of the wilderness without the punishment of camping. But fear not, you're not totally left to your own devices; on arrival you can expect bed linen, towels and a load of dry wood and kindling for your out door fire pit. You can enjoy the simple things in life, without compromising on basic comforts.\n\nThe Conker is high on a hilltop but fully insulated and equipped with a cutting edge air recirculation heating system to keep the interior the perfect temperature all year round. If you're an early bird, catching the sunrise with a mug of steaming coffee must surely be the very best way to wake up, as you listen to the soothing sounds of wildlife, and watch the resident red kites as they fly gracefully through the air.\n\nInside the Conker, you will find hotel quality mattresses and a double bed which folds into a sofa during the day. the owners have not forgotten the little things that really make for a comforting stay, so you'll find your gleaming conker equipped with a cutting-edge air recirculation system to keep you toasty in winter, and cool in summer. All sheets, bedding and towels are provided.\n\nThere is a small, internal kitchenette with an induction hob for basic cooking.

You can re-charge your mobile devices with the USB ports in the Conker, as well as listening to your playlists through the Bluetooth-enabled sound bar. Set the LED lighting colour to suit your mood. Why not head out to the firepit for a spot of marshmallow-toasting, then relax on your terrace with a hot toddy as the first stars appear in the dark, unpolluted sky.\n\nAdventurous guests can opt to start the day by squeezing into the outdoor feature copper bath for an eye full of morning mountain views.\n\nDeliberately off-the-beaten-track and offering the 'off-grid' experience, The Conker is a couples retreat looking for a digital detox. As such, there is no wifi or TV. Your companions will be roving sheep, chomping squirrels and of course the wheeling red kites.\n\nThe drive up sets the tone aptly, a narrow lane winds up the valley, and two miles of roughish track with few passing places, two gates to open and an eventual ascent by foot to make you marvel.\n\nThe Conker is completely private and it not intruded upon by the main farmhouse and and that it sits within.

The room features a comfort double-sized bed, a single reclining sofa bed, and a cozy bedroom chair where you can kick back and relax with a book or hustling on a laptop before rolling into bed.\n\nThe upper level of the house also features a balcony on the east side and the dreamy hanging net right in front of your bed. Carefully spin the east door to enjoy sightseeing from the east balcony especially when the sunlight softly appears to charm you up from your restful sleep. If you brave enough to try relaxing on the hanging net while enjoying the magnificent view of Mount Agung, open the north side window and go down slowly to the net. Layback and chill like you were floating on a soft cloud. It is okay to also bring pillows and blanket to the net because anyone can fall asleep by the soft wind of the Sidemen Valley.', 'Other things to note', 'Other things to note\nBEFORE YOU BOOK, PLEASE READ A FEW DETAILS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION:\n\n1. The Construction\nThe construction and furniture are mostly made of locally-sourced bamboo that covered with rice straw roofs. The building is designed and built by local bamboo artisans with serious consideration to the strength of the entire part of the construction and furniture. The lower level floor is a half meter from the ground with a higher edge on the north porch; please take care of your step while playing on this site. The upper level is 2.5 meters from the ground with stairs that are considered easy to climb; watch your head and hold the railing for your safety.\n\n2. Water, Electricity, and Wi-Fi\nThe water you use in this house is supplied by the regional water company that distributes fresh water sourced from Mount Agung aquifer. Although the water is fresh, it is not ready to drink water, so please drink only water that is served in the bottle and ask the doormen to refill if it runs out. The electricity installed in the house is connected with the main east Bali grid system to assure you have reliable lighting in the night and optimum power supply to your device. Because we understand you may physically off-grid, but your digital presence can have no break. So, Wi-Fi is free as always.\n\n3. The Location\nThe small town of Sidemen is less crowded compare to Ubud and any other tourist destination in Bali. This area is slowly growing as the indigenous culture and society remain preserved by its humility. You can explore the village in a short-range by foot, a scooter is also available to rent if you want to go a little bit further to the town center or the neighbor village.\n\n4. Public Facility\nThe small town of Sidemen has a village hall, traditional market, small grocery, school, and hospital with an emergency care unit. Ride a scooter around 5 ‚Äì 10 minutes from the bamboo house to reach one of these facilities. Bigger public facilities are available in the nearest town of Semarapura that requires a 20-minute drive or Denpasar that is around 60 minutes from Sidemen.\n\n5. The Climate\nThe climate is divided into two seasons, dry or wet. The dry season comes around May ‚Äì September while the wet season is from October ‚Äì April each year. However, climate change has made the weather a bit unpredictable. Sometimes there is a rainy day within the dry season, and not all day is rainy during the wet season. When you stay during the wet season please consider facing heavy rain with a wind that may blow water into the lower ground porch, the upper balcony, and the hanging net. However, we have installed curtains and roll-up blinds at the lower ground so you can protect yourself from rainwater or bugs in the night.\n\n6. The Bugs\nThe bamboo house is located within a rice terrace with rich biodiversity. Our commitment to reducing the carbon footprint has led us to design the house with minimum impact on the surrounding living organism. Stay in this bamboo house means that you are willing to share your living space with other creatures. Ants, fly, mosquito, and other insects are commonly found outside of the building especially during fruit season. As long as you keep the space clean and not leave any left food open, they will not come to disturb you. If you notice mosquito entering the bedroom area, we highly recommend you to use the mosquito net on the bed during your sleep. If you have a specific insect allergy or afraid of these insects, we suggest this bamboo house is not good for you. Or you may go at your own risk.\n\n7. Room Services\nYou have a doormen stand-by at 7.00 am ‚Äì 9.00 pm at the upper ground, you can ask him almost anything you need to make your stay enjoyable. He will help you with breakfast, food for lunch and dinner, find a masseur, room cleaning, laundry, transportation, area information, and tourist activities. You can also contact us online through Airbnb platform in case the onsite services do not meet your needs.\n\n8. Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner\nBreakfast for two is included in your booking. You can ask the doormen to serve the breakfast in the spot you want. Whether it is floating on the pool, on the couch or you feel too heavy to wake up from your bed, the breakfast will be served at your convenience. We plan to have a small restaurant in the upper ground so that you can order food for your lunch as well as dinner. For now, you can walk around as there are several restaurants available near the house. Or you can ask the doormen to buy one.\n\n9. Air Conditioning\nWe do not install air conditioning in the house as it is against our spirit to maintain natural air remain fresh and healthy. Matter-fact we think we do not need that urban stuff around Sidemen Village, especially when you let the soft natural wind flows into your space.\n\n10. Use of Hanging Net\nThe hanging net is made of strong string with iron steel pillars to sustain the weight of the user. Using the hanging net means you understand the risk that you may fell off to the side of the net if you are not careful. Only use the hanging net if you are confident that you have a good balance and always have your partner watching you in case you need help to get back to the room. Do not use the hanging net after hitting even a shoot of alcohol. Do not jump down from the hanging net and do not hang on it as it is your pull up bar.\n\n11. The Neighborhood\nAs the bamboo house is located in the main tourist district of Sidemen, several accommodations and restaurants are situated near your space. You will see some buildings on the west side of the house. Right at the back of the house is also accommodation with several rooms. The neighbor is warm and friendly, especially the owner of the surrounding properties. However, to make sure you have great privacy during your stay, we have created a high bamboo fence at the back of the house and plant dense vegetation on each border with the neighbor property.\n\n12. Irresponsible Behavior\nIrresponsible behavior and threatening and abusive conduct towards the host, doormen, neighbors of the house, and the villager will not be tolerated. The host will refuse to allow check-in to the house if there is any case and or information that assume the guest (s) have related to any irresponsible behavior, threatening, and abusive conduct toward the mentioned person above. The host also has a full authority to end guest stay in the house if there is any case and or information that assume the guest (s) have related to any irresponsible behavior, threatening, and abusive conduct toward the mentioned person above. No refund will be given regarding the cancelation/canceled stay due to irresponsible behavior, threatening, and abusive conduct toward the mentioned person above.\nThe host will not have a further responsibility to the guest once the booking is canceled and or the stay is ended.']","['What this place offers', 'Scenic views', 'Garden view', 'Mountain view', 'Pool view', 'Valley view', 'Bathroom', 'Hair dryer', 'Shampoo', 'Hot water', 'Shower gel', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Dryer', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Hangers', 'Bed linen', 'Iron', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Dedicated workspace', 'A desk or table with a chair and space for a laptop.', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Refrigerator', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Stove', 'Location features', 'Private entrance', 'Separate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor', 'Private patio or balcony', 'Private backyard ‚Äì Not fully fenced', 'An open space on the property usually covered in grass', 'Outdoor dining area', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Free on-street parking', 'Private pool', 'Services', 'Pets allowed', 'Assistance animals are always allowed', 'Breakfast', 'Breakfast is provided', 'Host greets you', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: TV\nTV', 'Unavailable: Washing machine\nWashing machine', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Smoke alarm\nSmoke alarm', 'There is no smoke alarm on the property.', 'Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm', 'Host has indicated that no carbon monoxide detector is necessary.

This cottage is a woven basket with a living bamboo and traditional grass roof leaving it totally open and in nature. Some people have asked about security. It is very secluded and very safe. there is a cabinet you can lock up valuables in if you like. We have staff available to assist you and ensure you have what you need at all times. You will be very well cared for.\n\nSleeping in nature is something most of us don't do as we sleep in sealed rooms. It can be transformative to sleep in a natural setting, open to the cool night air, listening to the crickets and chirping geckos, the sounds of the nearby rushing stream with the fireflies glittering in the night. Don't let the unusual openness of the space deter you, this is an experience you won't soon forget.Bali 101:\nWelcome to Bali, no this is not like where you are coming from. To hopefully enhance your experience we want to provide you with a bit of cultural context. People often feel disappointed when they try to make Bali what they are familiar with. We hope by describing a few scenarios that this helps as Bali has things about it that may be very different than you are used to.\n1. ‚ÄúThere is a lizard staring at me from the ceiling who pooped on the floor and there are ants crawling along the wall in the bathroom‚Äù The outdoors will come inside. Crickets, spiders, and certainly a resident gecko and wasps will all join you in your living space. No matter how fancy the villa there is no keeping them out. Given that all of our bathrooms are open air this is something to embrace as part of the experience and not be afraid as they are all harmless.\n2. ‚ÄúI can hear roosters and dogs and the temple and even the occasional pig being sacrificed at midnight, oh and the crickets are too loud to sleep.‚Äù Yes indeed, all true. When I think of Bali I think of roosters, they are very proud of their fighting cocks and spend a great deal of time with them, often keeping them quite close to living spaces so your neighbor may very well have one. our neighbor certainly has both and his dog barks a lot and has attempted to scare away many a guest but don't be afraid he is harmless. The temple is a charming sound that echo thru the night and adds the to atmosphere but it can be less charming when they begin to sacrifice pigs at midnight. Peaceful Bali? Well its all a matter of perspective bali is here to be itself not just to be a peaceful place for you to relax, enjoy these new and unique sounds as part of the atmosphere and don't expect it to be an instagram photo, it is a real living place.\n3. ‚ÄúAn old lady with a machete and no shirt on just wandered into my living room‚Äù Balinese have a very different relationship to personal privacy than we do. It is not uncommon for neighbors or rice-field farms to wander into your space and personal property. because they are curious about you or simply because they want to borrow your sugar. They may not even ask as they would imagine you would do exactly the same. This can be very startling at first and takes some getting used to. You are welcome to ask them to leave but do keep in mind they are more than likely not there to harm you just used to sharing personal space.\n\n4. ‚ÄúThere are naked people in the stream by the house‚Äù it wasn‚Äôt very many years ago that all Balinese women were topless as their normal daily attire. Now only the traditional old women still maintain this style of dress but it is still very common to see people publicly bathing in ricefield streams naked. You may even see this from your front porch. Don‚Äôt be alarmed this normal here and they will not even feel embarrassed if you wave \uf04a\n5. ‚ÄúThe guy tried to over charge me‚Äù there is a very different relationship to money here. Think of it as a tug of war with a rope in the middle, it‚Äôs not that they are trying to steal from you or cheat you or have anything against you at all they are just pulling on the rope to get as much money as they can, if you don‚Äôt tug back then they won. Don‚Äôt get angry or feel the need to have hurt feelings just negotiate calmly to lower the price to something fairer. Negotiate everything in every situation, you will use these skills later when you need to ask for a raise with your boss. ;)\n6. ‚Äúeverything is damp‚Äù yes this is the tropics and especially during the rainy season everything can feel a bit damp and can mildew quickly even within a day. If your clothes need fresh laundering after being in a suitcase or if the sheets need to be changed for this reason just let us know and we will assist you.\nWe hope these scenarios help you to be prepared if you face them and feel free to let us know should you need additional help navigating in this new environment.

We drive in and out regularly in our small Honda hatchback and have had hundreds of visitors drive up in their ""regular"" cars. Indeed the forestry road has a few potholes worth slowing to 5mph, but otherwise can be driven at 20mph. The rainy winter season creates puddles but actually better traction than in summer, counter intuitively. The bridge ramps narrow and all you need to do is drive it slowly, consciously. Pretty easy.\n\nNote: Plenty of people have very relaxing, enjoyable satisfying experiences here in our sustainable culture experiment, but this happens only when reality exceeds expectations. This is where I try to talk everyone out of coming to stay with us -- MMV is NOTHING like a resort or the Marriott hotel. Think some crazy combination of camping/glamping at a rugged, mountainous, off-grid, remote farm and sustainable community. There may be a compost pile outside your cabin after we weed the the beds around it. Our goats, chickens or dogs may wake you in the morning. There are all kinds of critters here including but not limited to spiders and bears and all in between. We live here and make messes, undertake all kinds of projects including big building projects sometimes. It is NOT polished, not always tidy (although we really try) convenient or even (sometimes) comfortable. You may have to split your own firewood.

Quiet, cozy, romantic- in the lush sanctuary of nature.\n\nNote: No washroom in the cabin but one a short distance up the lane.\n\n*NEW* Check out our Airbnb profile to book our other Cabin (Bracken) listing or The Studio Loft\n\nCheck out more about Fernwood Hills fernwoodhills.com', 'The space', ""The space\nWe started off offering this tiny space for day use so people just like you, could come away from their office or their work, and clear their mind. Just a couple years ago, there were several couples, that asked us if they could stay overnight and have the experience of quieting their minds. Their heads were spinning because they just needed to disconnect from all the chaos and for a day or overnight, listen to their breathing and look out the windows to nature and wildlife. Here, you are in the forest, but not the dense part and it overlooks green space and trails. Retreat, re-wind, and re-fuel by yourself or with your significant other. Maximum of TWO people and both must be adults.\nImportant to NOTE: NO Washroom in the Cabin. There is a nice washroom, with a shower, but it is NOT inside the cabin. It is a TWO MINUTE drive up the lane or if you decide to walk it will take longer.\n\nYou have the option if you want to add on food delivered to your door. There might be restrictions on availability due to Covid or allergies or other situations.

However, this space is not to be booked through airbnb for business uses, including use as a photography studio or a work studio if you are having others or clients come in to have business with you. Those inquiries are welcome and we do that, but it must be an inquiry through our fernwoodhills.com website and details will be given and pricing and availability.\nYou might also want to have our photographer take photos of you for a short time example: engagement or proposal, then that is allowed to be requested here through airbnb.

We are passionate about what we do here and the opportunities we have to help others each day through our property.\nRomance, quiet, and cozy are keywords that describe our spot.\nEven if you are single the importance may not be on romance but certainly on the quiet, mindfulness and disconnecting. One of our passions is personal growth and understanding yourself better as well as others. We want you to be able to ignite your dream again, believe in yourself again, and believe you make a difference in this world. You were made for a special purpose and we hope our quiet spaces help you to discover this in a deeper way.

In the winter months when the ""public washrooms are closed,"" the main lovely washroom is just a two minute drive on the property up the lane. Up until recently we rented the cabin out for 6-8 hours ""day-use"" for relaxation, writing, reading, painting, re-balancing or whatever quiet you need. It is still available to be rented for day use, however many people have asked to have the ""overnight cabin"" experience.\n\nWe heat it all winter with an electric heater, however, we want to encourage you when it is very cold to bring a sleeping bag or extra blankets and extra warm clothes so you will be ""warm"" all the time.\n\nIf you would like to upgrade your booking you have a couple options.\nIs this a surprise for a special someone?

d42233a7-5bfb-42e0-a3bb-85b85ba5f28d,Offbeat,WORLDS GREATEST BEACH HOUSE,"['About this space', 'WORLDS GREATEST BEACH HOUSE', 'The space', ""The space\nSouthern California is more than just a lifestyle, it is a vibe, a connection, a mood and most of all a glorious undertaking in enjoying all life has to offer in a great climate bounded by sun, surf and sand. We humbly submit that if you rent this home, you will agree that from the desert to the sea throughout the entire state there is, quite simply, no finer home to experience the dream of southern California. Buckle up folks, you are about to enter the Water Tower Experience.\n\n(For a video of the home, please click on the video box in the photo montage)\n\nThe name says it all ‚Äì THE WATER TOWER - for the those unfamiliar with perhaps the most famous beach-front landmark in all of California, let‚Äôs start with a little history. Located in one of Americas tallest ground to ceiling residential structures and serviced by a commercial elevator that whisks you upwards of close to one hundred feet in the sky; this almost 3,000 square foot home was, in fact, southern California's first man-made tourist attraction. Long before Knotts and Disneyland, indeed, before the first automobile was registered in Orange County, the Water Tower stood marveled at by visitors and locals alike as a wonder of engineering and architectural bravado.\n\nAs for the structure, it stands over 85 feet tall and has three stories with windows on all sides. This amazing home is beyond well-appointed, it has been professionally renovated and decorated with first class amenities, appliances, thousand-thread count linens and top-shelf accoutrements, so that your experience in southern California beach living is not only first-class in every conceivable way, but a memory you treasure forever. No detail has gone unnoticed as the owners endeavored to create a home that will reward every person who enters an indelible lifetime memory. The interior designers charge was simple; pay tribute to the history of the Water Tower and when finished we wanted every guest who stays in the home to leave and tell everyone they know about the magic of the Water Tower Experience. As you can see from the photos, we believe the decorators and designers hit this one out of the park. The home has two garages, an elevator, four bedrooms, three and one-half bathrooms, a fully stocked kitchen, bar, laundry room and the most amazing living room you will likely ever encounter with 360 degree views of southern California and beyond.\n\nNow that we have the structure out of the way, let‚Äôs get to the fun stuff ‚Äì the Water Tower Experience ‚Äì as natives know, the debate has raged for years over what is more ‚ÄúSo Cal‚Äù, Orange County and its miles of pristine beaches or LA with a bit more traffic, but mountains and beaches and a whole lot of glitz. As you enter the Water Tower Experience this won‚Äôt be an issue ‚Äì you are part of both. Tower locals, however, might argue as to whether or not she resides in Sunset Beach or Seal Beach as they both claim her. It really doesn‚Äôt matter as, make no mistake about it, while, like the beaches, the Water Tower belongs to all Californians. It is the love child of Sunset Beach, but Seal Beach is very much the proud Father. As you stand on the sidewalk, please take a moment to look up and take in the grandeur of this magnificent 19th century landmark which was once the tallest structure in Orange County and today stands as the second tallest residential home in the United States.\n\nAs you enter you will see the fine artwork on the doors and plaque detailing some of the history of this home which was built to service the railroads in the last half of the 1800‚Äôs as the steam engines required a tremendous amount of water to power the locomotives. The Tower could hold up to 75,000 gallons of water which weighed over 37 tons so don‚Äôt worry about whether or not the she is strong enough to support your family. The entry way is a tribute to the Tower and the workers who built her. From vintage tools and a water fall to the Burlaps and Barrels bathroom you will feel the history of the Water Tower as soon as you cross the threshold into a home experience like non-other. You will also be introduced to the tower mascot ‚Äì Mr. Wally Tower. As your stay unfolds, enjoy finding the hidden ‚ÄúWally‚Äôs‚Äù around the home. There are several intriguing finds on this floor including a bedroom with a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù room located behind a bookshelf (where some folks believe the ghost of Wally resides). After taking in the entry level, get in the elevator and start your stay.\n\nOn the second floor you will be thrilled to find a wonderful lounge, dining area and fully stocked kitchen with all new state of the art appliances and cookware. The view is nothing short of stunning as walls are in fact mostly windows revealing the entire Pacific Ocean. Slide open the doors and walk around the entire tower or simply sit on the deck and enjoy the view of the beach and Catalina. This is the lowest indoor floor of the Water Tower, yet you are still 60 feet in the air with a majestic view. Throughout the Tower you will find a number of treats and architectural gems including magnificent stained glass windows and custom wood-work. This floor is no exception. Look up at the ceiling or simply give a listen for the whistle of the trains circling around the ceiling. These trains are replicas of those serviced by the Water Tower over a century ago. The lounge has not only amazing scenery, but we believe some of the most comfortable chairs you will ever have the pleasure of sitting in as you enjoy the view and your stay. This floor also hosts a bedroom with bunk beds dedicated and decorated in recognition of a little know part of California history ‚Äì Pirates. That‚Äôs right, Pirates. Specifically, Hippolyte Bouchard who after raiding Monterey, plundered Mission San Juan Capistrano while cruising up and down the coastline.\n\nA short trip up the beautiful winding staircase leads to the two master suites. Facing towards Los Angeles you will find the Whale Lovers Bedroom with a view of Huntington Harbor, Bay of Los Angeles and White‚Äôs Point which is the land jetting-out from the end of San Pedro to form the outline of our Los Angeles coastline. This room not only has all new fine linen, but a world class shower sunken with an equally impressive view to enjoy while you experience this wonderful rain shower. On the other side of the floor you will find the Dolphin Bedroom with a view towards Huntington and Newport Beaches. We think you will find this suite equally impressive with unapparelled views and a bathroom shower with a view of the San Gabriel Mountains. All bedrooms are equipped with brand new HD televisions with Direct TV.\n\nNow it is time to journey to the top floor or Rotunda Room of the Water Tower. This room which stands over 80 feet above sea level offers a 360-degree view of all of southern California. From the Hollywood sign to San Clemente Island for as far as the eyes can see you will have an unobstructed view. If for some reason that is not enough for you, we have numerous magnifying devices including a custom-made viewfinder so if you are curious about what the crew of a passing sailboat looks like, just zoom in and take a gander. The room itself is designed to entertain and be enjoyed by up to 20 people. There are four large screen curved HD televisions so you can watch all the games. Or if you simply want to sit on the custom leather chairs or new couch and enjoy the view then don‚Äôt forget to take in the 100 gallon fish tank or be certain to look up at the stain glass ceiling. As you look up you will see propellers. Those too are part of the history of the tower and its unique role as a coastal landmark during World War II. This floor includes a custom bar, video station with over 600 different games and a lifetime of breathtaking views.\n\nNow that you have seen a glimpse of the inside of the Water Tower Experience, we invite you to think about spending a little time on the exterior. Just a few short steps and you will find yourself on an elevated outdoor deck 50 feet above the ground with everything you need to enjoy the views and the beach without stepping off the lot. The deck boasts not only a jacuzzi and BBQ, but also the amazing Breakfast Bar perfect to take in the sunrise or, our favorite, the Sunset Bar which provides perhaps the best view of the sunset over Catalina in all the land. Indeed, we would put a view of the sunset from the Water Tower, up against any other on the planet ‚Äì it is that spectacular.\n\nOf course, we do not expect you to spend all of your beach vacation indoors so we have provided beach cruisers, stand up paddleboards, body boards and an array of beach toys. While you are less than 50 yards from the beach, we also provide a wagon so you can pack your toys for an easy jaunt to one of the best beaches on could ever hope to enjoy.""]","['What this place offers', 'Bathroom', 'Hair dryer', 'Shampoo', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Washing machine', 'Dryer', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Hangers', 'Iron', 'Entertainment', 'TV', 'Home safety', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Hot tub', 'Lift', 'The home or building has a lift that‚Äôs at least 52 inches (132cm) deep and a doorway at least 32 inches (81cm) wide.', 'Services', 'Self check-in', 'Keypad', 'Check yourself in to the home with a door code', 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Private entrance\nPrivate entrance', 'Unavailable: Heating\nHeating']",Seal Beach California United States,9,5,3.5,876,4.7,5,4.9,5,4.9,4.7,19,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/30321967?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A8225&children=0&infants=0&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2022-05-30&check_out=2022-06-06&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=5a234b9f-ba93-42d8-8853-79e87ba16031,4,

Very peaceful and quiet - the only house on the street. I call the area 'country suburbia' with houses peppered in the neighborhood about 1/4 mile away. This is a monolithic dome which means a huge balloon was blown up and sprayed with concrete before the balloon was popped. That part of the house is 34 ft diameter with rustic wooden floors & two 5 1/2 ft round windows over looking great views & yard. (The yard is not totally secure for pet safety.) Large kitchen, very roomy open plan space; king bed/queen bed in the loft, a smart TV and selection of DVDs for your entertainment. The picture shows a ladder going to the loft but it is now a stair case. The loft has an artsy 2 1/2 foot 'picket fence' as a wall. There is sight privacy, but due to it being a half wall, there is no sound privacy. Parents note: Please look at the pictures to decide if this room is child-safe for your needs. About 2 % of folks decide it's not right for them.I imagine it should be no problem unless they are climbers when you're not looking! Please ask for details if you're unsure.

This large house has entertained our family and friends for generations, and we‚Äôre thrilled that now you can share it with yours, too. Be in nature but minutes from downtown!', 'The space', 'The space\nOur grandpa designed and built this unique home in a way that captures the rugged terrain on which it sits and compliments the stunning natural beauty of the Colorado National Monument that serves as the backdrop. He made it so every room has its own stunning view. Look closely at the photos to see the rock and wood detail throughout. The sandstone slab of the hill on which it‚Äôs built actually makes up the entire wall of the downstairs family room and the floor of the room above. Grandpa had artistic vision, creativity, and the craftsmanship to put it all together and he built this house from his heart. (He was still building furniture for us well into his 90s!). It has served as a cherished place for family gatherings, and we invite you to enjoy your vacation the way we have enjoyed this home throughout the generations. Have breakfast in the kitchen or on the giant deck, while enjoying unobstructed views of the Colorado National Monument and the way the morning sun hits the red rocks. Spend evenings by the massive fireplace watching the sun set over the Bookcliffs and the Grand Valley. During the summers you might catch a lightning storm over the grand valley as the thunder echoes off the massive canyon walls behind the house. We also have a charcoal grill so you can BBQ outside and take in the views from the deck. Take leisurely walks through the neighborhood or drive/bike to get to everything that Grand Junction has to offer. (See list below!)\n\nSee our video tour: search ""House on the Rock"" and ""Grand Junction"" on that big video platform that everyone uses (stated in a way that gets around a ban on mentioning websites here). :)\n\nWhile most of the home furnishings are rustic and cozy in a way that preserves the years of fond memories, we made sure you had enough upgraded guest amenities to make your stay as comfy as can be: we just remodeled our showers, have hotel-quality linens, plush towels, and plenty of toiletries. You get to enjoy a vacation with maybe the most gorgeous views in the Grand Valley, in a house full of charmingly-old stuff spanning generations, but you still get to sleep as if you were staying in a great hotel.\n\nPlease note- we try our absolute best to keep the house clean for you and all of our future guests.

A stay in the Ball-Paylore lets you step back in time. Widely published, the 1200 sq. ft, two bedroom architectural landmark has been named one of the most significant examples of Modern Architecture in Arizona. Centrally located within the Historic Catalina Vista neighborhood, the property is close to the UofA and major attractions, entertainment and shopping.', 'The space', ""The space\nIn 1952, librarians Phyllis Ball and Patrica Paylore commissioned legendary Tucson architect Arthur T. Brown to design a bespoke, one-of-a kind home. One that embraced the tenets of the modern movement, responded to the environmental conditions of the Sonoran Desert and offered both beauty and function.\n\nThe result was an architectural masterpiece - considered one of the most important buildings of Brown's design career. The avant-garde design of this noted and forward-thinking project embraced geometry and siting to create a pioneering and early passive solar home. The south facing floor-to-ceiling windows shed light on the authentic mid-century interior. Bold original colors are punctuated by pale wood finishes and earth toned polished concrete floors. The primary living areas radiate off the central fireplace - like the petals of a flower. The dark colors of the bedrooms, with sloped low beam ceilings, create intimate and comfortable spaces.\n\nThis significant historic property was purchased at the end of 2019 and meticulously restored by Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation. The property retains its classic charm. The 1200 sq. ft. architectural plan is based on the geometry of the hex - featuring two bedrooms plus a shared bathroom. Much of the original modernist furniture by George Nelson for Herman Miller and custom Tucson furniture maker John Kelso are extant. Recent upgrades have introduced contemporary amenities - including air conditioning and wireless high speed internet. Each bedroom features a TV, and Tuft and Needle mattresses.\n\nStep back in time.

bcdfdac0-3be8-49a4-9cdc-8ced5ffdb543,Beachfront,2 Bed Seafront Regency Apartment with Sea Views***,"['About this space', 'Welcome to our hideaway by the sea. Our cosy home is within a beautiful coastal Grade II Listed building near the shores of Brighton beach, with direct and uninterrupted panoramic sea views. Well located on a prestigious main street in Kemptown village, the sea is literally across the road while the Pier, The Lanes, Brighton Marina and all the other amazing places are just a stroll away. The interior has been crafted for comfort, relaxing and snoozes, with a sprinkle of style on top.', 'The space', ""The space\nOur coastal retreat is on the 3rd floor of a grand Regency Grade II Listed building on Brighton‚Äôs seafront. So as you step into the apartment you‚Äôll be welcomed by the stunning direct sea views, neatly framed by the sash bay windows. We‚Äôve kept other original features (inc. the slight wonkiness of the floors and ceilings), but have combined that period character with a modernity to create a home that is relaxed, delightful and practical. Our apartment has two good sized double bedrooms, an open lounge/dining/kitchen main area, and a bathroom.\n\n-THE LOUNGE is airy and bright with wooden flooring and casual furniture. There‚Äôs also a writing desk/chair with USB charging. The dining area is placed by the window, so meals can be enjoyed with a sun lit sea view.\n\n-THE KITCHENETTE is compact but serves most short holiday needs inc. electric induction hob, oven, fridge freezer and ample storage space. There‚Äôs also a microwave, toaster and cutlery, crockery and basic cooking utensils.\n\n-THE LARGER BEDROOM is very generously sized with a king size bed, side tables, dressing table, built-in wardrobes with plenty of hanging space and other furnishings to ensure a restful experience. The quirkier second bedroom hides behind a sliding door and has bedside tables, furnishings, and a double bed facing out at the ocean.\n\n-THE BATHROOM is clean, functional and includes storage, vanity unit, washing machine and a bath tub offering the option of a good long soak or a quick shower.\n\nThe apartment has gas central heating. It also has a hair dryer, iron, ironing board, and fresh towels and bed linen are provided. The building doesn‚Äôt have a lift though but the elevated views will hopefully make the short ascent to the apartment worthwhile.\n\n-PARKING\nFinally, whilst we don‚Äôt have a dedicated parking space but our guests normally dont have a problem on getting a good spot. It is basically on street metered parking (between ¬£12-16/day), closest space is right opposite to our building.\nUsing the ‚ÄòPaybyphone' parking app is a great way to monitor the parking time remotely. Highly recommend."", '', '', 'Other things to note', 'Other things to note\nOur apartment is within a friendly Regency building shared with a few other households, some with young children, so it‚Äôs not suited to any guests thinking of parties or other noisy activities. It is also on the 3rd floor, so do bear that in mind when booking as there is no lift.']","['What this place offers', 'Scenic views', 'Beach view', 'Ocean view', 'Sea view', 'Bathroom', 'Bath', 'Hair dryer', 'Hot water', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Washing machine', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Hangers', 'Bed linen', 'Iron', 'Entertainment', 'Ethernet connection', 'TV', 'Heating and cooling', 'Heating', 'Home safety', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Dedicated workspace', 'A desk or table with a chair and space for a laptop.', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Refrigerator', 'Microwave', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Mini fridge', 'Stove', 'Oven', 'Location features', 'Waterfront', 'Right next to a body of water', 'Beach access ‚Äì Beachfront', 'Guests can enjoy a nearby beach', 'Services', 'Self check-in', 'Lockbox', 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Shampoo\nShampoo', 'Unavailable: Private entrance\nPrivate entrance']",The City of Brighton and Hove England United Kingdom,4,2,1,149,4.8,4.9,5,4.9,4.9,4.7,33,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/20049793?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A789&children=0&infants=0&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2022-08-12&check_out=2022-08-19&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=541099da-d405-434f-bf22-2ae363c7e3f3,2,

The deck area in front of the house has a beautiful view over the beach towards Portsmouth. We had a great time with our 2 year old son, popping over to the beach and back all throughout our stay. Roger was the perfect host, helped with ferry bookings and told me everything I needed. Gary and family 19th July 2021\n\nA nicely decorated, tasteful cosy cottage just by a wide spanning beach. There are a number of relatively close shops if you don't mind a short walk through the nice seaside town of Seaview. The place itself was well fitted with a full kitchen and all the bits and bobs you need on holiday. There are a multitude of sites to visit around the property, with a beautiful nature reserve just a hundred metres from the front door. The shore changes from sandy beaches to shingle beaches, with a welcoming setting no matter your preference. Inside The Beach Side you'll find all you need with a TV and stable WiFi . The two bedrooms were comfortable and quiet at night and the living space has a modern sliding window out onto the communal gardens and the path out to the sea (only 30m or so away). Overall, a great place to stay while you explore what the Isle has to offer. Monica 12th July 2021\n\nWe had a lovely stay on the Isle of Wight. The accommodation was perfect for our needs.

We often see red squirrels running around the garden and lots of interesting birds too. The kitchen has a Rangemaster double oven, dishwasher and plenty of cupboard space.
